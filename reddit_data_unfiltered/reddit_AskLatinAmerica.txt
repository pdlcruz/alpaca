How do you feel about today's inclusion of USA into Latinoam√©rica In my opinion having a coup and storming the congress are obviously cultural appropriation


************How to respond to gringo denying the existence of white latinos A photo of Marina Ruy Barbosa (Brazilian actress who's a natural redhead with freckles) was making rounds on Twitter and the responses were like "no she's isn't a real Brazilian" to "she's a colonizer". Her family has been here for some 100 years. The fuck they want us to do? Ban her? Lol

The rounds of "cultural appropriation" are even more hilarious. Brazil is this insane soup of mixed cultures where we created the "sweet sushi" and half of the attendees at African religions centers are white but then there's a freaking YANKEE screaming cultural appropriation. 

They wanna be so woke they don't realize they're being imperialists by applying AMERICAN standards to how to navigate another culture.

No, we don't operate with the same standards. And ah yes, white latinos are a thing. No they aren't "italian-american, slavic-american, german-american" as you guys say over there. They're simply Brazilians. No, we aren't kicking them out.


************I want to say something to all the americans in this sub It's literally the second day in a row that I have to argue with **americans** in this sub who apparently know more about my own country than I know. I've seen something like this happening weeks ago in this sub, but it didn't happen personally with me until recently. Please, if you're in **AskLatinAmerica**, you're supposed to ask questions about Latin America and to read answers about people who live there. Even engage yourself in healthy discussions where you can share your own experiences. But it's annoying and disrespectful trying to teach ourselves about our own countries.

Thank you all for your attention. Have a nice day. üôÇ

************What‚Äôs the most third world latin american thing you‚Äôve ever done? Half the products in my country are imported illegally. Meaning if you buy it and don‚Äôt ask for a bill, you‚Äôll get it a lot cheaper as if you bought it and asked for a bill. Because if there‚Äôs no bill, there‚Äôs no record of the purchase thus the seller pays less taxes. 


So I was in Berlin buying an cellphone for a friend in a certified legal Apple Store. He gave me the money and when it was my turn to pay I couldn‚Äôt believe how expensive it was. 


The first thing that left my mouth was ‚Äúhow much if there‚Äôs no bill‚Äù? The cashier just stared at me and it took a few seconds to sink in. But when I realized what I had said I died inside and was like ‚Äòwell shit‚Äô.


I just payed him and left thinking that‚Äôs the most bolivian thing I‚Äôve ever done.

************[MOD POST] Please, do NOT ask questions that UNILATERALLY and SPECIFICALLY refer to U.S. born Latinos. Although we do not aim to discriminate, this sub is primarily made up of Latin Americans that are born, raised, and currently live in LatAm ‚Äî not the US. This wouldn't normally be needed to be stated in a post like this, but at least every other day I need to remove a thread for being off-topic due to this. Before you post into a subreddit, make sure you know the kind of crowd that will be reading your post just so it will not be a misfit. 

This does not mean it is prohibited to talk about the US or Latinos. What I am saying is that you should not ask question aiming *specifically* those. For example, I have just had to remove a question where we were asked whether Joe Biden had our vote. This isn't a place to ask that, as we on thids place overwhelmingly do not hold U.S. citizenship. I know this is due to Reddit's nature of having an American bias, since the site was created there. And again it is fine to talk about the US (I have lived there myself), but do not get too specifically into U.S. born Latinos, please.

Thank you.


************Joe Biden just asked how the USA would be seen if it was interfering with other countries elections. What do you guys think? How would the USA be seen under such unfathomable circumstances? The textual words were 

> "How would it be if the United States were viewed by the rest of the world as interfering with the elections directly of other countries and everybody knew it? What would it be like if we engaged in activities that he engaged in? It diminishes the standing of a country."

************What would you like to know about Suriname? I'm from Suriname, and I know that not many in South-America know about Suriname. We are actually a small, Caribbean country, because of our culture. In Suriname we learn a lot about the other countries in South America. We know about the history; like how Brazil was once an empire and that some prince of Portugal lived in Brazil, or how Venezuela and Colombia were once part of Gran Colombia. We learned about Geography too. From the Amazon, to the Pamapas. The Titicaca lake, the Iron mining in Chile, the Atacama desert and the Andes mountains. These are just some things I can recall from junior high school. Our country is so small, that in at least two school years, a child will have learned everything about the country. Afterwards we have learn about North and South America and the Caribbean.

But I know, you guys do not really learn a lot about us, so what would you like to learn or know about Suriname?

What do you think of it? I honesty cant believe how someone that is supposed to represent the country cant think for a minute about what the fuck he is saying.

The phrase itself originally is attribued to a Mexican writer many years ago but he changed the words and it came out pretty worse.


************Which country that is usually thought of as "a nice guy" has actually acted like an asshole towards your country/people? In the case of Mexico, Canada is the obvious answer. The fact that Canadians are nice is even a meme. but mining corporations from Canada that operate in Mexico have terrible practices.

They take advantage of corruption and weaker regulation to monopolize natural resources and destroy the environment. While other developed nations make sure that their private corporations follow certain regulations even on foreign land, the Canadian government turns a blind eye.

Some of the profits of the largest Canadian companies come from offshoring practices that would never be allowed in their own land.

Is there a similar story with your own country and a "nice guy" that doesn't act as such?


************Wait so Latinos DON'T speak Latin? That was years of academy training wasted, should I learn Hispanic, what language do you peopers all speak?


************Why do you think Americans are obsessed with race? I don't mean to imply there is no racism or race politics here, god knows Ecuador is racist af.

However it seems like gringos are really into race, and knowing where their ancestry comes from, and they know about some old grandparent who was part German, they take those DNA tests, "I am 1/24 parts Cherookee" etc. 

It just seems weird, nobody I know here has any idea where they ancestors come from, most of us just assume that we are european+indigenous and be done with it.

This is the 3rd highest rate of population decrease on the planet. So can we get an F in the chat from every Latin American nation?


************Mexicans come from the natives, Brazilians from the woods, Argentinians from ship - and Chileans from the lava of volcanoes, Panamanians from the tides of the two oceans, and Peruvians from the axe of Quechua warriors. Where does every Latin American population comes from?

************Cubans decided to legalize same sex marriage in Family Code Reform referendum (67% yes vs 33% no) I just read this news. What do you think? Which Latin American country do you think will be next?

So now Cuba is the fifth country that legalized same-sex marriage this year:  


>As of 2022, marriage between same-sex couples is legally performed and recognized in 32 countries (nationwide or in some jurisdictions), with the most recent being Chile on 10 March 2022, Switzerland on 1 July 2022, and Slovenia on 8 July 2022. In Andorra, the law allowing same-sex marriage will come into force on 17 February 2023, after being promulgated by Emmanuel Macron on 17 August 2022. Cuba will legalize same-sex marriage on September 30, 2022, after the passage of the Family Code referendum.

************On this day, in 1973, a military coup happened in Chile against the socialist president Salvador Allende, after which an infamous General Augusto Pinochet seized power and established a military dictatorship that lasted till 1990. How Chileans evaluate this event and what happened after it? Also, it would be dishonest from me to leave out this fact: the coup was supported by the USA as they attempted to weaken any kind of left-wing movements in Latin America.


************Who is the most handsome man in LATAM and why is it Chayanne? 


************How racist is your country? A bit of context from me. I am a white Mexican from CDMX and it honestly disgusts me how much racism there is in Mexico against indigenous and African Mexicans. Even though the country is overwhelmingly mestizo, when you walk through the streets and look at the people in ads on the windows on stores, or when you watch movies or when you watch ads on YouTube here in Mexico, all of the people are white. Being white is so glorified here and even though us Mexicans always complain about racism in the US, the amount of times you here derogatory terms like naco or indio here makes us seem like hypocrites.

Now that‚Äôs my take on Mexico. How racist is your country? Also if you are Mexican and disagree with me I‚Äôm happy to hear your opinion as well.


************Are you aware of what's happening in the Amazon cities rn? Did you see it on the news? Ok, quick summary. You can read more on it [here](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/1/16/brazil-covid-hit-amazonas-state-receives-more-emergency-supplies) and [here](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jan/15/brazil-premature-babies-manaus-coronavirus-covid-19) , or just search for "Manaus covid" and check for recent news. Basically, our government here in Amazonas, a state in Brazil, is useless, and after months of insistence on "early care" (hydroxyclorochine and friends) and no effective measures, the healthcare system just collapsed. All the higher ups knew that it was coming and only started moving after thousands of people died. Our people are absolutely abandoned. Right now, many organized civilian groups took the job of the government and are coordinating actions to collect supplies.  Hundreds of people die everyday due to the lack of medicine, oxygen or food. 

My question is: are you aware that this is happening? Did the news reach you? Did any campaigns for resources reach you? Rn it feels like not even our friends in the Southeast and South care, so I wonder how's the situation in Latin America.


************Do people in your country wear shirts with strange things written in English on them? In Colombia I see people all the time wearing shirts that have vulgar or nonsensical things written in English on them. 

Examples:

-Man with a shirt that said ‚ÄúHOMELESS‚Äù in big print. I don‚Äôt think he was actually homeless.

-College student with ‚Äúfearness hurts more than swords‚Äù shirt

-Middle-aged man with ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not A bitch, I‚Äôm THE bitch‚Äù shirt

-Shirt with Timon and Simba saying ‚Äúdid somebody say brunch???‚Äù

-Shirt that said ‚Äúborn to kiss, forced to kill‚Äù

-Middle-aged woman wearing a shirt saying ‚ÄúTOO MANY FUCKING IDIOTS‚Äù 

And it‚Äôs super common to see hoodies and hats that just say ‚ÄúFUCK‚Äù in all caps. I think it might be a brand.

Have you seen these kinds of shirts in your country? I honestly love them.

************As a Filipino, I've finally come to terms with my colonial past. But I hardly meet likeminded Filipinos. So I ask LatAms in this sub: am I welcome here? My country, the Philippines, used to be a Spanish colony. 

In my pursuit of wisdom and knowledge, I have finally reconciled myself with the facts. I -- the Filipino identity -- is very much rooted in the colonial period.

But I am hard-pressed in finding other Filipinos like me. I also wish to read the Spanish literature of my country, but alas, I was born during the years that Hispanophobic presidents removed official support for Spanish, and so here I am, learning the language by my own effort. 

There's a lot a I wish to learn: there is plenty that I do not know.

Am I welcome here, to learn from you all?

Many thanks!


************Does your country also have cars with huge speakers selling stuff like eggs/gas/whatever? This shit annoys me so much and there‚Äôs nothing I can do.

************Not a question, but I feel like I need to say it. North Americans: this whole continent isn't ruled by your politics, and your politics are not the same as ours. You need to understand that,

* our left and right are different than your left and right

* there are dictators

* there will be dictators

* sometimes it's not about religion, or left or right (it's about democracy)

*  not every politician is either "a far left extremist" or a "far-right fascist"

* latin americans have minds of their own 

Please, not everything is about left or right and which is good and which is bad. Sometimes, you need to get off the political lense and think "why?".

That's all, thank you very much.

Some people are saying this is influential everywhere, but I don't think so. I think american politics rule in Reddit because, well, we're in an american website. Do you think that american politics are influential everywhere?

************Latinamericans living outside of Latin America, have you ever had a moment of "immigrant solidarity" It's when you randomly meet another immigrant (from latin america or not) and you get talking or help each other out.

It happens a lot to me in Portugal since there are lots of Brazilian and also African immigrants. 

One time my mom was in the supermarket and a lady asked her with a heavy accent where something was. My mom answered and asked her where she was from. The lady was Venezuelan and they spent 15 minutes talking.

Another time I was in the subway discussing with this classmate who said slavery was not "that bad". This random 2 meters tall angolan guy tapped him on the shoulder and told him he was full of shit and helped me in thr argument. Me and this angolan man left the train at the same stop, he wished me the best of luck. It was the best thing ever.


************Since this is a sub about LatAm, why are we talking about USA's September 11 and not Chile's?

************Women of Latin America, how is it like growing up in your country? As a woman myself, I've always been interested in the experience of women from other countries. I'm from the Philippines, and growing up here, for the most part, has been an unpleasant experience. 

As a kid, I was often told that girls are supposed to be submissive and docile and to be in charge of cleaning all the household tasks while my brothers went off and did their thing. And for many, catcalling is a regular occurrence, and you never truly feel safe walking by yourself, even in broad daylight. (Of course, it depends on which area of the country you're in.) Don't get me started on the toxic macho and victim-blaming culture over here. 

So, tell me, how is it like to be a woman in Latin America?

**Edit:** Thank you so much for everyone who shared their stories! It has been incredibly enlightening and I‚Äôll definitely read every single one of them.

**Edit 2:** These stories are really heavy and depressing to read. It‚Äôs enraging and blood-curdling and it‚Äôs so horrifying to think about what the world has come to. I just have no words. Thank you for being brave and sharing your experiences here. My heart goes out to all of you - and all the other women whose stories remain untold.


************What do you think of the Cavani scandal? As a black person I am the first one who understands we need strong action against racism, especially in soccer.

Now, what's happening with Cavani is absurd. Saying to a friend *felicidades negrito* is not racism. What the hell?

Instead of focusing on real actions to fight against racism, why are people focusing on these stupid things that don't help at all.


************The murder rate statistics for Latin America and the Caribbean for 2020 are out and there were some big surprises. The general trend is that Latin America is becoming safer. What do you think? [Source - Spanish](https://es.insightcrime.org/noticias/analisis/balance-insight-crime-homicidios-2020/)

[Source - English](https://www.insightcrime.org/news/analysis/2020-homicide-round-up/)

 I had heard crime was decreasing in **Venezuela**. It seems it is partially true. A lot of people state it is because of the high number of people who have left the country. Sad place for **Jamaica**, however I think they have had higher murder rates in past years and it seems that what happened is that most countries are decreasing their rates even more. Crime in **Honduras** seems to have stabilized. I knew crime had decreased in **El Salvador**, but a murder rate of 19.7/100,000 is really low, I am not a fan of Nayib's but he has done a lot to improve the security situation. I was even more surprised (and happy) about **Guatemala**. Sadly, this means that **Mexico** is more violent than Central America now, even though it seems murders stabilized in 2020 (It also caught my attention that 15% of murders were committed in one state: Guanajuato). It is the first time in more than three decades that **Brazil** has a murder rate lower than 20/100,000, it also seems crime decreased in Rio de Janeiro (A lot of people say Bolsonaro has nothing to do with this, but if it were the opposite they would be blaming him). **Panama** and **Costa Rica** seem stable while **Uruguay** has improved after two difficult years. **Ecuador** and **Peru** seem to have increased their rates a little bit in the last few years while **Argentina** has improved a bit.

After analyzing this report it is more than clear to me what without the stupid War on Drugs we would have a way more peaceful region.


************Why is clubbing so boring in the first world? I'm Colombian and after a couple years abroad I realized that dancing/clubbing in the first world is either just jumping in place by yourself or trying to hook up with someone. In our culture (and I'd say most of the third world), music and rythm actually mean something.  Dance moves should match the genre and its pace, as well as the chemistry with the dance partner. Most importantly, dancing does not necessarily mean you are trying to make out with anyone. I feel like this concept of party that we have in LatAm is something inconceivable by the first world. What made the same concept so different?


************Uruguay is the Latin American country with the best democracy. It is stable and there's no political uncertainty. However, it still doesn't attract as much investment as it should. What could be the reasons for this situation? Uruguay is kind of an outlier in Latin America: solid democracy, low corruption (by regional standards) and stability. These characteristics should make Uruguay the country where all companies would like to invest. This is not the case. What could be the reasons for this?

I have a few theories and I would like Uruguayans to let me know what they think about them:

1. Regional factor (being located between countries that are unstable comes at a price)

2. Small internal market

3. High taxes (even though there are some special zones)

4. Economy dedicated to agriculture and food exports

What could other reasons be?


************Are you also suddenly feeling very Argentinan?

************I want to make a game here: Portuguese speakers can only speak Spanish and vice versa. Read the discription***

The idea is that Portuguese speakers can only speak Spanish, only using words they know and Spanish speakers can only speak Portuguese (same thing only inverted) and you have to carry on a conversation just using that (you can chat whatever you want).

The goal is to talk for a longer time without a misunderstanding

In case you don't know enough words, you can invent/guess to make it more "similar".

Rules: 
1. You can't speak your mother language
2. You can't use google translator or anything like that.
3. You can't be disrespectful

************Do you watch national porn? I'm talking about the professional porn industry. So, here in Brazil we have Brasileirinhas, but their porn is... Awful. all actresses have big thighs and big asses, silicone, and bikini tan marks. most of them moan as if they are being exorcised. Porn actors seem to have been chosen on a construction site, and the cameraman often focuses on the actor's ass ... However, we are the largest exporters of porn with transsexuals in the world, not to mention that our porn industry is number 1 in porn of women farting, vomiting and shitting (2 girls 1 cup is Brazilian). How is the porn industry in your country? is it successful?

************Is the United States far more similar to Latin America than people assume? I think a lot of Latinos tend to view the United States as this "other" in the continent. It gets bundled separately with the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, etc. as part of the cultural Anglosphere.

That said, having lived here for a while, I'm always still surprised by how "Latin American" it feels. No, I'm not talking about the demographics. We all know that the U.S. is the 3rd most populous Latino nation in the world (with 62 million Latinos, it is only behind Brazil and Mexico). I'm talking about the culture and history.

When I visit a place like Brazil, I'm very surprised by how much it reminds me of the U.S.

For example:

* The U.S., unlike Australia, Canada, New Zealand, has a revolutionary history much closer to Latin America than the opposite. In fact, the "American Revolutionary War" would be used to justify the Haitian Revolution and the Bolivarian Revolutions of the early 1800s.
* The U.S. government - a Presidential system with a bicameral legislature and a judiciary as a check - became the Latin American norm as well. So you see the same political dynamics at play historically of the "strong macho leader vs. the elitist corrupt legislature" narrative. Like Latin American countries, the U.S. places their Presidents on a historical pedestal and there's even a cult of personality around many of them (the "Founding Fathers", Roosevelt, Kennedy, Reagan). The cult of Trump isn't even that dissimilar from Brazil's Bolsonaro fans or Mexico's election of the populist Obrador.
* In the U.S., there is a major cultural division between rural and urban areas. The cities are extremely left-wing and progressive (with rainbow flags, racial diversity, high levels of education) and the rural areas are extremely right-wing with a strong focus on religion, guns, and 'rugged individualism.' This divide seems to be very similar to many Latin American countries too.
* The U.S. is 41% racial minority, which makes it an extreme outlier in the Anglosphere. A lot of this is also due to climate. The U.S. didn't have slavery because it was more "evil" than the rest of the Anglosphere. It had slavery because its climate in the Southeast was conducive to large-scale plantation economies based on slavery. So the U.S. climate of a humid subtropical Southeast and an arid Southwest has guided its history in ways that have mirrored Latin American conflicts. If the Southeast were as cold as, say, Iceland, the U.S. would have never had slavery and it would have developed completely differently. Climate shaped America's political conflicts to mirror those of Latin America, not the rest of the Anglosphere.
* Inequality in the U.S. is more similar to that of Latin America than the rest of the Anglosphere. Someone who is extremely wealthy or gifted will thrive in the dog-eat-dog world of U.S. society. There is a major socioeconomic divide between the "haves" and "have nots"
* The evangelical revival in Latin America makes the U.S.'s religious landscape increasingly intertwined with Latin America's. It's essentially varying degrees of Catholic/Mainline Protestant/Evangelical coordination to thwart increasing irreligiosity.
* From salsa music (created in New York) to baseball (now a mainstay through much of Latin America) to even Taco Bell, the average U.S. person has far more exposure to Latin America than to other Anglosphere cultural strains. British culture is considered as "grandma culture." Watching Downton Abbey is what your Boomer parents do. Nobody watches Australian or Canadian or Irish or New Zealander TV. Yet Latin culture is omnipresent. Drunk frat boys go grab burritos at midnight, reggaet√≥n is blaring in the clubs, Karens are planning their next Caribbean/Mexico vacation, every baseball game is just a giant recitation of Hispanic surnames.
* The U.S. has a very strong strain of nationalism that is far more akin to what you'd find in Latin America. I can't tell a Peruvian from a Bolivian but that doesn't mean I haven't heard them bitch endlessly about the other. Latinos have this great gift in making up stereotypes about each other and aggrandizing their own national story as unique and special. In many ways, the U.S. is similar.
* In the U.S., the corporations reign supreme. The Good: the U.S. has massive multinationals like Amazon, Apple, Coca Cola, Comcast-NBC, Costco, Disney, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Netflix, Pfizer, Tesla, Visa, Walmart, etc. The bad news is that politics is very transactional and there's a level of corruption that would feel at home in Latin America.
* There is a big difference between a Brit and a U.S. American. Brits are dry, sarcastic, biting, a bit quieter and less open initially, whereas U.S. Americans are loud as hell, extremely "look at me," far friendlier, and more...dynamic. There is a liveliness in U.S. American culture that is very reminiscent of Latin America. There's a rowdiness to it all. If the President does something idiotic, you have riots and protests. There are major celebrations and barbecues and parties to commemorate big moments. There is a festiveness that I don't get from the rest of the Anglosphere.

I'm sure I've generalized a bit here, but is the main thesis wrong? Is the U.S. far more Latin American than people perceive? I think most people default to English = Anglo, Spanish/Portuguese = Latin, as if language is the only prism by which cultural similarities can be judged. But if we peer under the hood, it seems the U.S. is far less Anglo, and far more Latin, than meets the eye.

************Is anybody else tired of how men on the internet sexualize latinas As a latino myself ill be the first one to tell you that i love latinas. Yes, latinas are beautiful. However, and im confident this is due to porn, im tired of seeing young dudes all over the internet making memes about latinas like they are just sex toys.

There are tiktok accounts of dudes just hanging around on walmart‚Äôs or malls, with a hidden camera and approaching latinas to flirt with them. Theres nothing wrong with flirting, but they are recording them and blatantly choosing certain angles to show their cleavage/glutes and just straight up harass them. 

These same dudes translate what these women are saying in spanish and randomly include the world ‚Äúpapi‚Äù in there when they never said that.

Is just so fucking weird. You can admire latinas but stop acting like they are just brainless chicks whose only purpose in life is to wear mini skirts, fuck  and call you papi.

It infuriates me so much idk why lol

TRANSLATION (thanks to the redditors u/ThisIsRoland and u/atenux who helped with this. I don't know if that's the right to tag you people, sorry) 

"I would like to be able to write this in English, but I cannot. Today is a sad day for my country. Today, a fellow protester, exercising his right, has died. There were 11 shots fired by the police. In the neck, in the head. He went to march to repudiate his government, and the police killed him. And this, neither the Minister of Interior, nor the dictator Merino has acknowledged.

[UPDATE]

Second murder on the demonstration by the police. A young 24 years old man. Shot in the thorax. No Police chief has put ford an statement.

THEY ARE KILLING US

[NEW UPDATE]

4:11 in the morning

11 ministers have step down. Those who stay are: prime minister, √Åntero Flores-Ar√°oz;and jobs minister, Juan Sheput. All of this, not even considering that Merino does not plan to resign because "he does not feel responsible", and awaits for the congress to take him out with a programmed session a 8 in the morning.

Meanwhile, the holice as surrounded the protesters and haven't let them get to main zones of manifestation. In spite o the deaths, they are still shooting. Yes, four in the morning, and there are still people outside, and a lot are missing.

Let this be clear, that what peru is living right now is a dictatorship.

[LATEST UPDATE]

MERINO HAS JUST RESIGNED 

ORIGINAL

Me encantar√≠a poder escribir este post en ingl√©s, pero no puedo. Hoy es un d√≠a triste para mi pa√≠s. Hoy, un compa√±ero protestante, haciendo valer su derecho, ha muerto. Fueron 11 disparos por parte de la Polic√≠a. En el cuello, y en la cabeza. Fue a marchar para mostrar su repudio a este gobierno, y la Polic√≠a lo mat√≥. A eso, se suma que ni el ministro de Interior, ni el mismo dictador Merino han dado la cara. 

[ACTUALIZACI√ìN]

Segundo asesinato en la manifestaci√≥n por parte de la Polic√≠a. Un joven de 24 a√±os. Disparo en el t√≥rax. Ning√∫n jefe de la Polic√≠a se ha manifestado. 

NOS EST√ÅN MATANDO

[NUEVA ACTUALIZACI√ìN] 

4:11 de la ma√±ana 

Ya van renunciando 11 ministros. Los que se mantienen en el cargo son: el primer ministro, √Åntero Flores-Ar√°oz; y el ministro de Trabajo, Juan Sheput. Todo esto sin contar que Merino no planea renunciar porque "no se siente responsable", y espera a que el Congreso lo saque de su cargo en una sesi√≥n programada hoy a las ocho de la ma√±ana. 

Mientras tanto, la Polic√≠a ha rodeado a un grupo de manifestantes y no los dejan salir de las principales zonas de protesta. A pesar de las muertes, siguen disparando. S√≠, cuatro de la ma√±ana, y a√∫n hay gente afuera, y un gran n√∫mero de desaparecidos. 

MERINO ACABA DE RENUNCIAR


Que quede claro que lo que est√° viviendo el Per√∫ es una dictadura.

************How common is the "tiger blanket" in your country? Is it proven that its warmer than other types of blankets?


************Why Latin Americans are more excited than Spanish people when I speak Spanish? In my experience, when I speak Spanish to people from Latin America, they are usually really excited. For example, there was Colombian girl at work who was kind of cold to everyone, but when she found out I spoke Spanish, she became really friendly to me and was really excited. Meanwhile, when I speak Spanish to people from Spain, they are usually "meh" or even prefer to speak in English.


************I just want to know in how many countries is common to open the fridge and find a dry half lemon on the fridge door? EDIT: In Argentina we call "lemon" to the yellow one, and "lima" to the green one. By the way, we do not have limas in Argentina, only yellow lemon. Limas a very rare to find here. Some argentinos commented they got them.

According to comments, countries like Mexico, Colombia, Ecuador, they call "lemon" the green one because it's more common for them and the yellow one is rare.

In Brasil they have several names for different varieties.

************Someone from the US just told me, a latin american, that latina is an "opressor term". Is there anyone here who actually agrees with this? I am from Brazil and saw a discussion about latino heritage online and surprise surprise there was a lot of misinformation being shared. There was one woman from the US (whose family supposedly were from Latin America) who was arguing that someone who had one Argentine parent, grew up in Argentina and still speaks spanish was not actually latina.

Well, I disagreed with her and then she called me "blanquita" and said she knew my ancestors were conquistadores and that I "probably love to brag about my european slave owning ancestors". What the fuck? My ancestors were dirt poor and arrived in Brazil after slavery was abolished. 

She ended her diatribe by saying latina is an opressor term. Are there any latinos in Latin America who actually agree with this nonsense? I had never heard of this before.


************How do you feel about Americans who refer to themselves as "Mexican" or other nationalities without having ever stepped foot in the country? I've noticed this as a very American phenomenom, where someone whose grandparents were immigrants from, say, Venezuela, refers to themselves as "Venezuelans" on the internet.

Or, when you ask them what's their heritage, instead of saying "I'm American" they say "I'm English, Irish, Venezuelan, and Mexican on my mother's side." Do you have an opinion on this?


************Help us save an Artisans Market in Uruguay Hi, everyone

I am a ceramist from Uruguay. Two months ago I made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/asklatinamerica/comments/mmy08e/help_for_uruguayan_collective_institution/), when we opened a crowdfunding site. As I wrote before, I am a part of an artisans association, we all sell collectively in a market that's been open since 1979, all handmade works, from ceramics to handknitted garments to woodworks, long etc. We sell mostly for tourists, and you can imagine we've been having a very hard time this year and a half, as every tourism-related business have. We've tried to sell online, to sell through facebook live, we've done raffles, etc.. We are in the last days of our crowdfund online, and I wanted to post for a second and last time here, in case anyone could and wished to help. Every bit helps, and this community has been super nice, even some people said they've been at our market when they traveled to Uruguay. I want to thank the mods too, who allowed me to post and have been super nice too. 

I know the pandemic has been brutal for everyone, and so many people are struggling. We here in Uruguay had an incredible spike in cases and deaths in the last months, but hopefully with the vaccination advances things will open at the end of the year. We just need a little help to get through. If you're ever here in the future, reach out! Here's the link, y'all be safe and have a great week.

************Germany is going to pay $1.34bn compensation for Namibia genocide, do you believe your country should receive reparations for slavery and colonization? 


************Recent controversy between Portugal and Brazil, what is your opinion? Also, has something equivalent happened Between Spain and other LatAm countries? So, a Portuguese [news article](https://www.dn.pt/sociedade/ha-criancas-portuguesas-que-so-falam-brasileiro-14292845.html) talked about how during the pandemic Portugese children started saying Brazilian expressions, words, and sometimes even speaking with a Brazilian accent, due to exposure to Brazilian content creators, specially on youtube. Some Portuguese parents are even taking kids to speech therapists to make them sound more Lusitan again.  


I have already asked here before about the Spanish spoken in LatAm dubs, and it seems it's more of an artificial Spanish, and when it comes to internet content, I really don't know if there is a country that shows up more online than others and if some countries also feel threatened for having younger folk choose a different accent, so I am curious to know if something similar happenes to hispanohablantes.  


I'll leave my opinions on the matter in the comments.

Therefore, I thought  it would be interesting to see a residential working-class neighbourhood and a residential wealthy neighbourhood in our cities around Latin America, so please post your example using a Google Street View link!

I'll start. I'm from Santiago Chile:

* [This is a working-class neighbourhood in La Pintana/Puente Alto in Santiago](https://www.google.com/maps/@-33.6152262,-70.6229271,3a,75y,16.88h,84.75t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s0oWqfTNZLw4KM3SNZ6lDhA!2e0!7i13312!8i6656)

Looking forward to see yours!

EDIT: It's actually extremely interesting how I can sort of see three "types" of cities jugding by their architecture but also their "vibe" (which is super subjective I know):

* Andean/Central American (Guatemala City, Quito, Lima, etc.)
* Tropical (Cali, Rio, Kingston, etc.)
* Southern (Buenos Aires, Santiago, etc.)

************People who live near the border to another Latin-American country, how is it? What are elements of the neighboring-country's culture prevalent there? I live in Argentina, southern Patagonia, near the border with Chile. I have family members born both in Chile and Argentina. Mostly grandparents and their siblings, from a time when borders weren't really that important and people lived lives on both sides.

Where I live (in Argentina) you can find traditional Chilean *cuisine* like *papas rellenas, picarones, milcao, calzones rotos, curanto.* I've also personally tried, without leaving Argentina, *sopa de luche, chapaleles, empanadas de pino*, y podr√≠a seguir.

I wonder if it is like that in other borders across our wonderful Latin-America.


************Would you like for your government to allow Afghan refugees into the country? Almost the entirety of Afghanistan is back under Taliban rule, and in this chaos thousands upon thousands of people are desperately trying to escape the country by any means necessary, many of them leaving for destinations unknown. Many are in the blacklists of the Taliban and will likely be killed by the group as soon as they finally establish themselves in power.

Would you support your government if they took the decision to let in a certain amount of refugees into your nation? And why?


************Clime is acting weird in your country? Here in Chile, we are having the weirdest Winter I can remember

In Southern Chile, Winter comes with  rains that last for weeks. It rains like buckets here 

But something weird it's happening lately. This year, we barely had any rain. The Temperature it's still cold though, but it's not raining. Like a day of Summer, but...¬øcold?

It's clime acting weird where you live too?


************Why is it so hard for US born latinos to say they're American? So after following r/latinopeopletwitter for a while, and seeing it in real life....why do so many Americans of latin american descent find it so hard to just say they're American? Why always "I consider myself mexican, Guatemala etc"?

I understand that their families pushed the idea on them that they're of that nationality and not actually American, but it's come to my attention how so many are ashamed to say they're American and insist on saying other wise, when they know nothing of the history of said country aside from the food and f√∫tbol and how to say cuss words

It's ok to say you're American. No one cares. You're much more a like to white and black americans than to latin americans


************Is rice and beans common in your country? Here in Brazil it's extremely common, people eat rice, beans, and meat (beef or chicken) almost every day of the week. What about your country?


************Brazilians, Do you feel ashamed for having been colonized by a rectangle? 


************Is placing broken glass on top of house walls common in your country? Also known as economic barbed wire. It's very common in Mexico. I have yet to see a house without some sort or anti theft protection, but placing the glass on top of the cement on walls seems to be the preferred method.


************Enough of talking about why we hate USA, let's talk about why we love Uruguay: 


************Does anyone find ‚ÄúSpanglish‚Äù really cringy or hate it in general? I always detested it it‚Äôs mostly used by Chicanos who try to show their ‚ÄúLatino‚Äù side I‚Äôve meet Green ghosts who can speak Spanish better to me and you know actually try to Speak Spanish not ‚ÄúThat‚Äù


************Have you ever met a foreigner who was a weeaboo but for Latin America? Someone from another country who was obsessed with learning about Latin America or a particular country in the region, ie the music, history, food, pop culture, maybe they have a map of Latin America or a specific LA country in their bedroom, etc. Have you met anyone like this? If not, what would you think about this type of person? 

Also for those who haven‚Äôt heard the term, a weeaboo is a non-Japanese person who is obsessed with Japan.


************Foreigners that frequent this sub: why? (asking after 1 year again) This sub has grown a lot so I'd love to see the responses! All foreigners are welcome


************Chile will nationalize the country's lithium industry, the world's second largest producer of the metal essential in electric vehicle batteries, to boost its economy and protect its environment, per Reuters. Do you think this is a good idea? 


************Brazil has the largest community of Japanese descendants outside of Japan. Chile has the largest Palestinian community outside of the Arab world. What are some other examples of large groups of immigrants settling in one particular Latin American country that people might not know about? Apologies for the long question, I wasn‚Äôt sure how to split it up into the body.


************TIL Brazil received as many slaves as the other 20+ countries of caribbean, north and s.america combined. Totalling 4 million slaves brought from [W.Africa](https://W.Africa) and Angola mostly.

By comparison, USA received about 300,000

Do you think Brazil is under represented in movies/culture about slave trade? I mean it basically almost 20x more slaves than the 2nd place country. Crazy stuff!


************Men of Brazil (or anywhere else in LATAM), is it a common fetish for guys to want to have sex with a girl while wearing a football jersey of the club they support? Using a throwaway for OBVIOUS reasons here.22-year old female. Just came back from a month in Brazil which I loved. 

&#x200B;

I went with a couple of my female friends from university as a graduation trip.In our last week we were in Salvador and went out clubbing and a few local guys, probably 19-20 years at most, saw we were just 3 girls and approached us. They were charming and good-looking, and spoke some English. I got on well with one and, long story short, he took me back to his place (don't judge me lol).

&#x200B;

So we sit in his bedroom watching TV, gently kissing before removing our clothes. Except just as I am about to go down on him, he puts on a football shirt, and keeps it on throughout the blowjob, as well as the sex that follows. He slaps me in the face many times during the oral sex as well as the sex, but I am the sort of person who really enjoys that, and we felt very sexually compatible It's great, we're having fun and then I just lay down on his bed.

&#x200B;

He takes off the shirt, and tells me to wear it to sleep. It smells of him, which kind of excites me. Anyway, we wake up and have sex again. Before he leaves, he says I can keep the shirt. Takes a picture of me wearing the shirt with his slap marks on my face, and says it would turn him on a lot if I didn't wash it and wore it and sent him a picture sometimes. He then kisses me and leaves.

&#x200B;

We have sort of been sexting over the last few days and when I sent him a picture of me wearing it in Copenhagen he got so excited and grateful lol.

&#x200B;

So, Brazilian guys, just asking: is this a thing? And what's with the no washing it lmao?


************Why do you think that the vaccination in Latin America is seen as a less politicized issue compared to Usa? 


************People that come from 1st world countries, why do some of you come to live here? It may sound as a complaint, it is not; I am genuinely interested why some people that live in 1st world countries come to live in latin america in general. It is known that there are bigger rates in violence, poverty, unsafety and other problems, compared to other regions. Living in Europe, for example, and used to a better standard of living (in average) I assume people must hear a lot about the bad side of the southern hemisphere. I can also imagine that some of your peers reacted to this decision. How was it? Did they approve that decision? How was it viewed by others? And, finally, a latin american I am genuinely curious about this: what made you come here? 
Edit: sorry if the question was kind of acusatory. I think that a better version would be "what has made you come?", but now I can't edit it.


************Latina women fetishization So I drive Uber for a living and I see all sorts of people who think its important to ask where I‚Äôm from, i answer but I get weirdos that go on tangents about how latinas are so hot and ‚Äúsexy‚Äù, that they take care of their men and know their place in a marriage. As a woman would you take that as a complement or would you stop them from stereotyping? I neither encourage nor correct them on these views because I try to keep my driver score high but what would you guys do in my position?


************Happy 70,000 subscribers! 


************The controversial debate: going for a date wearing a football shirt. Cringe or okay? What are your thoughts Every now and then Brazilians  argue about dress code for going on a date. 

Some women complain that they spend all day dressing up, perfuming, all made-up wearing Zara and Louis Vuitton bags, only to meet the "boy" wearing a shirt with "Pogba" on the back.

Some seem chilld about it tho and men don't issue the issue at all. how about the non-brazilians thoughts on this?


************So why is Brazil so into transgender porn? Pornhub just released their annual traffic annual data and apparently transgender porn is the #1 category there. 

https://preview.redd.it/idiussvt046a1.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&s=29c381b8b91620fec23fccb351ae6d3768af4f36

So why do you think so? Has transgenderism been a major topic in Brazil this year? Do you guys use another website for porn so it‚Äôs a selective bias because pornhub has more transgender porn than whatever website your country usually uses?

No kink shaming here, genuinely curious because you seem like a global outlier here.

Those other countries seem pretty standard. Mexico remains the #1 weeb with their love for hentai.


************Why are we Latinos viewed as being so promiscuous?  I'm currently studying in Europe & no matter where I go, once people find out I'm Latina they start to assume I'm "easy". Funny thing is, I don't dress or behave any different from the women in Europe. The only time I wasn't stereotyped was when I was invited to my Pakistani friend's wedding & I had to put on a hijab. One guy I went on a date with told me, in his culture women expect marriage before anything else, but since I''m a "Spicy Latina" I must be into casual encounters. Men always ask me, even face to face, for bikini photos, if my body is natural, or other very inappropriate questions way more than my female friends of different cultural backgrounds. What have we done to earn this "reputation"?

************Has a foreign singer/band been disrespectful in/towards your country? The most recent one in chile was 2020, maroon 5 made an appearance in a music festival thats also televised in a public channel. He showed up 30 minutes late, was supposedly unenergetic. In the backstage he was recorded saying "This was not a concert, it was a tv show. Fucking town. Assholes" anyway some people got pretty mad and he later apologised on instagram. Any story like this?

************Why are Arab immigrants so well integrated in Latin America? EDIT: Thanks everyone for the replies, didn't expect this to blow up as much as it did.

I want to first preface this question by stating that I am not right-wing or xenophobic. This question is simply a matter of curiosity.

In much of the English speaking world as well as in Europe, there is considerable debate regarding Arab immigrants and their ability to integrate into society. There seems to be a general consensus that many immigrants from the Arab world seem to face unique problems regarding integrating in western countries and often form very strict parallel societies.

Latin American, with its large Arab diaspora seems to have not faced this problem. It seems that people with Arab ancestry tend to be very wealthy and apart from their surname, tend to be no different to their fellow Latin Americans.

Why is this the case?


************Castillo dissolves Peruvian Congress I knew there was a chance Castello would take the country by force, but didn't expect it to come so soon. Police and military lock down from 9pm to 5am, looks like we are headed to a dictatorship.

************Native Spanish speakers, what does Portuguese sound like to you? Edit: hahah I'm having fun with the answers xD


************For the non-Brazilians, what does "gringo" mean ? In Brasil, they use the word "gringo" to refer to any non-Brazilian person, and it's a very neutral word, it doesn't have a positive or negative meaning attached to it. 

They are having a discussion at r/Brasil because some American guy got offended that a Brazilian guy called him gringo. I am trying to explain to them, that gringo doesn't have the same meaning and connotation in Spanish as it has in Portuguese, but apparently they know Spanish and Hispanic America better than me ( I am Venezuelan). 

So, I ask you, in Spanish, what does gringo mean? what type of connotation does it usually have?


************Which part of your country "doesn't exist"? Brazilians have this joke that the state of Acre doesn't exist; there's probably dinosaurs and UFOs there. So which state/province in your country is the equivalent of Acre?


************Twitter has been banned in Brazil. What do you guys think about it? I'm kinda surprised this unfolded this way. Brazil is a huge market for any company.

I'm gonna miss my dear Brazilian content creators üò≠



************In Brazil there is something called "flanelinha", which are homeless people who charge a sum of money to watch your car parked on the street. In practice, you are paying them to not vandalize your vehicle. Does this exist in your country? (not necessarily homeless people)


************What are some cultural shocks you had while vising other Latin American countries? When visiting Santiago, I was surprised by how liberal Chileans are regarding the consumption of marijuana. 

You see people smoking and rolling up everywhere, I had never seen anything like that in Brazil! I even saw poster ads for a cannabis energy drink inside the subway stations, that would never fly over here!


************US Latinos, Latin Americans, and social issues. A recent post in [LatinoPeopleTwitter](https://www.reddit.com/r/LatinoPeopleTwitter/comments/hn852w/conservative_starting_salary/) made me realize that many US Latinos expect all Latin Americans to be beacons of progresive thought and feel betrayed when some Latinos support the Republicans. Now, don't get me wrong, I hate Trump. But I do wonder why they think that all Latinos ought to be progressives? They even denigrate conservative Latinos as MAGAzuelans, fake Latinos or other such terms. From my own experience almost everyone in my country is very conservative when it comes to social issues, like abortion and gay marriage. We Latin Americans are not progressive at all, so why do US Latinos feel so surprised and betrayed when it turns out some of them are Republicans?


************What's an obscure fact about your country that not even most people from there know? 


************Merino (Peru's president) just resigned after yesterday's protests and killings. What are your feelings about it? What should happen now? [According to Tom Phillips](https://twitter.com/tomphillipsin/status/1328024499409866757?s=19), Latin America correspondent for the Guardian, Merino just resigned.

************Are we not alowed to talk about the racist insults that are common when there's an Argentina x Brasil futebol game? I saw yesterday someone made a post about it and it disappeared. Either way, it is incredibly common for Brazilians to be called monkeys during those games, and usually by the Argentinian crowd. I am not saying Argentinians are all racist, I'm really not, I've been to Argentina and was very well received, but considering how often this kind of thing happens there's obviously a problem here. In a game that happened yesterday an Argentinian was throwing a banana at Brazilians, and this is not an isolated case.  In Argentinian subs there are people laughing at Brazilians getting upset over this.

[On the internet Argentinians call Neymar and Brazilians "monkey"](https://www.otempo.com.br/superfc/futebol/nas-redes-argentinos-se-referem-a-neymar-e-brasileiros-como-macacos-1.2511130)

&#x200B;

I can go on with more sources. This isn't a thread to hate on Argentina, I honestly don't dislike Argentina, it's a beautiful country that I hope to visit again in the future, and if a foreigner ever shows up talking shit about Argentina I will defend you guys, but we can't pretend these are all isolated cases, and I think Brazilians should be allowed on this sub to call out this kind of thing.

&#x200B;


************Hey mods. Ban the racists, no? Seriously, the amount of foreign racist a-holes that come to insult us and our region is growing. Just like that Turk guy who in other forums spouses the ethnic cleansing of Kurds.

Edit: The mods have since banned the person in question. I just think recently these past few weeks, ever since the world cup shone a light on the region, that a lot of these foreign racists have come to shit on us. 

I don't know if it would be feasible, but maybe there's some way to screen posters, not commenters as that would be too much, whose immediate history shows the OP being a racist? Idk. It's tiring actually trying to explain my country's shit in depth only to later find out I'm talking to a racist wall.


************Some random guy just attempted to assassinate Argentinian VP Cristina Kirchner with a gun before being detained by police. Police says this guy is a 35yo Brazilian man. How could this affect South American politics as a whole? 


************Latin America is known for its religious devotion. Have any of you faced discrimination for being atheist/agnostic / non-religious? Are the rights of non-religious people respected in your country? I was kicked out of one public school, acussed of being satanic because I refused to pray, it got so bad that my family had to pay for lawyers because the school director brought a priest to the classroom to exorcise me (not kidding). Not to mention the "shame" I brought to the family because of the public scandal. 

However, the church keeps saying in all media that they are the one being attacked, and I've never seen anyone, ever, defending the rights of non religious people. Even when there is freedom of religion in the Constitution of Panama. 

In a different post about the Constitution, I commented that I did not believe in it, as I didn't believe in the Bible either. The response of a user was "FUCK YOU" and I got negative votes. Which brought me bad memories from school and it made me wonder if freedom of religion is respected here.

I would love to hear your opinions.

--

Edit: Thanks for all your comments. Some were nice, others not so much. But it confirms that religious freedom is still problematic in Latin America, although it varies in severity depending on the regions.

I get that for urban areas and larges cities is less problematic than rural areas. And smaller countries in Central America and the Caribbean are also having a harder time than bigger populations such as Argentina or Colombia. Education and wealth also play a big role. 

Lots of people still struggle, and cannot openly talk about religion for fear or starting a fight. I hope one day we can all openly talk about our views regarding God, or the lack of it, without being called edgy or militant. We are all entitled to our views and opinions and have the right to be public about it.

I now will stop answering to comments as it became too much. Thanks everyone.

Edit 2: A lot of people seems to think I was scarred for life or something. Just to be clear, I won the case, the director was fined, forced to apologized and ultimately lost her promotion because of her antics. I left the school afterwards on my own terms (that was 17 years ago) and with my head up high, and later my family got to terms with my "rebellion". I lost friends and some family members took distance from me, but I didn't care. I ended up in a catholic school and found a lot of support from the teachers and priests who accepted me the way I was.

Sometimes I can be harsh on religion, particularly when it is used to promote hate and oppression, and to deny people of their rights. But most my family is still religious, most my friends are religious, and I have no intentions for that to change. I am vocal about being an Atheist and an Anarchist, sorry if you find me "edgy".


************Did any ridiculous public issue happen in your country this week? This week in another episode of Argentina being a political shit show two things to highlight are: the Minister of Economics said he would bullshit his way through his speech without realising his microphone was on; and the other beyond ridiculous, unprecedented and unbelievable thing that happened was that a Congressman kissed his girlfriend‚Äôs boobs while in a Congress zoom session and try to excuse it.

************How will the assassination of the President of Haiti affect other Latin American countries? Do you think there will be spillover affects into other countries, or possibly other countries trying to influence the power vacuum that now exists in Haiti?


************What is the reason that the gringos place such importance on race? I think that Latinos give more importance to the country where you come from. 


************Are there people in your country who consider themselves "Europeans" Lots of people from S√£o Paulo and below think they're Europeans and that shit makes me laugh lol.

I get that you have Italian, Portuguese or German blood and are white af bruh but please, accept the fact that you're still a Brazilian macaquito to the eyes of some lmaoo


************Does it bother you that Americans think that being Latino is a race? It bothers me a lot, for example if you are "white" and you are Latino the Yankees do not believe you, I say it because it has happened to me and many people, I am blond and when I went to the USA and told them I was from South America they didn't believe me, they think that Latinos should all be brown and know how to dance salsa, be machista,be short and the Latinas are super sexualized , that bothers me a lot and I don't know if you too

Bothers: molestar


************Announcing /r/libertadores: a subreddit to discuss South American soccer A few years ago the subreddit was started with the goal of uniting the football-loving South American community on Reddit. We really felt the need to have an exclusive subreddit for our own discussions, since on /r/soccer it often happened that we were overwhelmed by the content that was mainly focused on the sport in Europe. 

The name "Libertadores" is not meant to say the subreddit exists to discuss exclusively that tournament, but rather it was created so due to lack of a better name. At /r/libertadores, we allow for discussion of anything related to CONMEBOL, from the leagues in South America, to the continental championships, to our National Teams, etc. 

/r/libertadores is a trilingual subreddit. Although English is the preferred language for smoothest communication, posts in Portuguese and Spanish are also allowed. 

I'm hoping the subreddit will gain some traction to allow for some discussion to be able to happen in there once more.


************Does anyone else find it impossible to discuss life in Latin America with Americans? I've found myself in situations in which I had to explain to Americans why I'd like to move out, why life in Argentina and generally Latin America sucks, and why I had no real hope of things ever improving here. Like 7 out of 10 times I had to do this, they replied with stuff like "Yeah but I've seen places here that look just like poor South American nations!!!", or "yeah but our healthcare is expensive!", among other things that had nothing to do with the conversation, and was just an attempt from them at comparing their nation with mine or others.

I know the US isn't a perfect place, but I don't understand what's with so many Americans victimizing themselves and trying to equal their situation with ours. Some of us might have it easier, some of us have it terrible, but even then the quality of life, access to practically anything, and prospects for the future of the average American is certainly better than that of the average Argentine, Brazilian, Venezuelan, Colombian, or pretty much any other nationality.

At this point I just barely like to mention what life here is like because often times the replies are just invalidating or even outright insulting. I honestly don't get it. Has anyone experienced anything similar?


************Latin Americans from smaller countries (less than 6MM people): Do you sometimes feel jealous of some of the advantages of living in a larger Latin American country? I am not implying Brazil, Mexico, Colombia and Argentina don't have problems, but I get tired of:

1. Having only one big and important city/metropolitan area. I am from the Capital District and all, but I do think we need at least two more cities to avoid being overcrowded.
2. Not having a decent industrial sector. I would love to have a solid manufacturing sector like Brazil or Mexico.
3. Everyone knows everyone and everyone is a cousin. This is horrible. In a previous job, three of my coworkers went to the same high school and knew each other beforehand. This fuels nepotism and gossip.
4. Not having a diversified economy. Because a lot of companies don't have interest in the internal market because they cannot achieve economies of scale, it is difficult to diversify the economy. It may sound silly, but a lot of Mexicans and Brazilians put food on their tables because of the entertainment industry. That's impossible here.
5. The need to travel to another country to experience different cultures, cuisines and climates.


************Does your family have a strong ‚Äúrespect the food‚Äù culture? So I‚Äôve seen those tik toks where people do gross stuff with food, or throw away lots of good food. And when I see that I can feel my grandma calling me every word in the alphabet if I did that lol. They always taught me to respect the food and never waste it, for example:

-When throwing away a small piece of bread you should kiss it first (some people don‚Äôt have any food and I have the luxury of throwing it away)

-When I was little and would pick on my food I would be told ‚Äúnot to play with the food and respect it‚Äù

-Also never throw away food if it‚Äôs still good

It's probably the most famous Mexican product in Brazil, so I wonder how well it is known / liked in  other parts of Latin America


************What would you include in a fantasy world inspired by Latin America? We've all seen fantasy worlds inspired by medieval Europe, or that zoom in to specific places such as Japan or Britain (God, so many). I've been working on a setting based on Latin America, incorporating magic, gods and monsters into a world similar to our continent in the 19th century in a way influenced by magical realism and Galeano. You can read the latest version [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/m9e1a1/after_a_few_months_of_writing_and_learning_to_use/) if you want, though I've already written a bit further and made a few changes based on feedback and playtesting - notably moving the "Tolkien races" to an appendix and making the default setting human-only for now.

My question is, whether you've read my setting or not or you plan to or whatever (it's really not important here), what elements would you be sure to include in a Latin American fantasy? Whether it's about tropes, references, specific legends, a way to tell stories, I'd like to hear what you think!

EDIT: Wow, this got an even better response than I anticipated! I'm really enjoying reading all your comments, and am flattered by your interest in the project. When the next version is out, I'll be sure to let this sub know in some way (that is, if the mods will allow a non-question post!)

************How is Latin America the second most peaceful region in the world in all seriousness. Latin America is actually one of the most peaceful regions if you look at it's conflict among each nations. Because almost every other region in the world among each nation they have had a conflicts within the past century. If you look at all the world major continents with the exception of the Australia region and North America there has major conflicts among nations in Asia, and Africa, and even Europe in the past century.

************r/asklatinamerica will join other subreddits in a site-wide blackout beginning June 12 # TL;DR: due to changes in Reddit's API, r/asklatinamerica will join the protests, turning into a private subreddit between 12 June to 14 June

### What is going on?

Reddit made some changes to how its API is accessed, effectively charging developers for API calls. That means that [third party applications](https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/5/23749188/reddit-subreddit-private-protest-api-changes-apollo-charges), [academic research](https://independenttechresearch.org/reddit-data-access-letter/), bots, and scripts that make Reddit better for users and mods will be affected.

Although talks had been going on for a while, the app r/Apollo (iOS) developer revealed that he would probably have to pay [USD20 million](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/13ws4w3/had_a_call_with_reddit_to_discuss_pricing_bad/) per year. Also, the app [got featured in the latest Apple WWDC event](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/141kfmi/wwdc_2023_event_megathread/jn0mt8a/).

Another thing: third party apps like Apollo are great for accessibility. This post over r/blind has more details, [click here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Blind/comments/13zr8h2/reddits_recently_announced_api_changes_and_the/).

### What is going to happen, then?

**r/asklatinamerica, together with [+1000 subreddits](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/1401qw5/incomplete_and_growing_list_of_participating/), will go private**, starting on 12 June, and will last for 48 hours. 

You simply won't be able to access the subreddit, or see new posts in your feed from us or subreddits that are going dark. The number of subreddits will only increase by the day.

### What can you do to help?

* **Complain to Reddit** over r/modnews, r/reddit, and other places where this is being discussed. Note that we're not encouraging you to spew personal attacks, hate speech, etc, towards the admins.

* **Spread the word**. More and more subreddits are joining every day via r/ModCoord, while r/Save3rdPartyApps has a list of our demands.

* **Boycott**. Your support comes from hurting Reddit's pockets.

This is not a decision that we, or any subreddit, take lightly. We believe that we still can make a difference, and [even come to an agreement](https://old.reddit.com/r/Save3rdPartyApps/comments/13yh2te/what_we_want/), but right now, these changes undermine the user experience on Reddit.

Is this a meme or do people in Chile typically not consider people from their country as attractive? I want to point out I never met a non-attractive Chilean nor am I saying that it‚Äôs a thing at all. I am more curious since usually people from our region tend to say ‚Äúpeople from our country are good looking‚Äù.


************What exactly is 31 Minutos? As someone in the US, all it seems like to me is a bizarre puppet TV show from Chile.

Could you guys explain to me why this show is so popular and what the hype around it is?


************What consequences will our region (especially South America) face if Argentina not only collapses, but doesn't recover? This question was inspired by a [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/argentina/comments/jb7kzb/la_fuga_de_profesionales_ya_iguala_a_la_del_a√±o/g8u7cx2?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) I made a few days ago.

Argentina is facing a very complicated situation today. It was already serious in January 2020, but the fact that Argentina implemented one of the harshest and longest lockdowns in the world worsened everything. All economic indicators are in a bad shape: employment, production, debt, inflation, foreign exchange reserves, etc. While Argentina has not been stable for decades, this upcoming crisis looks worse than the previous big crises (1975, 1989 and 2001-2002).

The region has been impacted by the Venezuelan crisis. However, if Argentina goes through the same thing (I really hope not) I think it could be even worse for two specific reasons. 

First, Argentina has a bigger impact on their neighbors than Venezuela. The economies of Brazil, Uruguay, Chile, Paraguay, Bolivia and even Peru would suffer an impact. Some of them will be affected more than others. 

Second, if Argentina loses 20% of its population in 5 years (like Venezuela) it means 9MM people will abandon Argentina from now until 2025. That's a huge number. Most of them are expected to reach Europe, but not all of them. Latin America won't be able to welcome most of them.

This is a mess. I really hope Argentina can recover after this crash. I know several regional economists are very worried.


************Is Latinos calling "Chinos/Chinitos" to Asians in Latin America the equivalent to Gringos calling "Mexicans" to Lantin Americans living in the United States? 


************According to local media, Afghan President Ghani has abandoned the country. The Taliban victory is inevitable. Thoughts? [https://twitter.com/TOLOnews/status/1426898337597464578](https://twitter.com/TOLOnews/status/1426898337597464578)


************What are the dumbest things people in your country take pride in? 


************Why does basically every latin-american country call americans "gringos" but Argentina doesn't and calls them "yanquis" instead? This question has always plagued my mind. The sole example of the usage of the word "gringo" to refer to foreigners by an Argentine I can think of is from a quote by writer and philosopher Arturo Jauretche: "Peor que el gringo que nos compra, es el criollo que nos vende". It seems as if the word is used in basically every single other latin-american country to refer to americans, so why did we collectively decide to just use "yanqui" instead?


************What is something in your country or Latin America that foreigners over romanticize? 


************How to solve the australian issue? In my opinion i think the australian government is not qualified to take care of their forests. We should seize them ASAP for more responsible nations to take care of it and prevent more situations like this.

Also we should try to boycott australian products by not buying them so that will bring more visibility to the issue.


************What is a little-known fact you‚Äôve learned about your country this year? Here‚Äôs mine: Brazil is the only known country to have had leaders of Romani (cigano/gitano) ancestry, both Washington Lu√≠s and Juscelino Kubitscheck were of partial Romani ethnicity.


************Abortion has ben decriminalized in Colombia up to 24 weeks, what's your opinion? 


************What's something about Latin America that you feel people have an unhealthy obsession with?

************Rita Lee, Brazilian Queen of rock, has died at age 75. Have you ever listened to her? [Source](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2023/05/morre-rita-lee-maior-estrela-do-rock-brasileiro-e-icone-dos-mutantes-aos-75-anos.shtml)


************Is there something that a person in your country would do that would scream 'I am upper class'

************To the mods of r/asklatinamerica: The cultural exchange was fun as heck I may be a bit biased because I am a mod of r/europe, but I had minimal, if any, participation on the cultural exchange there, since I'm not European. 

Here, in particular, I always get happy when [people ask about immigration in LatAm/Brazil](https://www.reddit.com/r/asklatinamerica/comments/l7rxm1/welcome_cultural_exchange_with_reurope/gl8cky3/), and offered some of my answers there to complement a great comment by u/brazilian_liliger. (You can see my two comments under his original comment, where I mention the Dalmatian Croats and the Nigerians in Brazil)

I hope for more cultural exchanges with other subreddits in the future! BTW, to the modteam, I suggest you try /r/newsokur (Japan subreddit) *in a few months*. I tried to get a cultural exchange between r/brasil and them and they explained to me that they had recent problems with a rogue mod, and many users left the sub, so the subreddit still have to grow its userbase back.

That's it, thanks for the cultural exchange, both as a user here, and as mod of r/europe! üòÅ


************Does your country have people who are nostalgic about the military regime or any authoritharian regime? Here in my country there are a bunch of people saying how the military regime was great, how we need an authoritarian regime and even more people saying that the empire should come back (no joke). Does your country have this type of people?  I do not condemn with any of them and will not express my political views.
(Had to edit the post description)


************Why does Latin America have low suicide rates when compared to Europe and US, especially Northern Europe? Seems like much more people end up ending their own life in North America and Europe than in the Latin America as a whole. A friend of mine suicided in middle of June, but here in Brazil and even more in RJ this is not too common. he was a nice guy. I was thinking: how and why this is more common in places like Sweden, Russia, US while in Latin America it's more like a taboo, stigma? Or at least Brazil.

I appreciate your answer. 

&#x200B;


************How do you feel about the fetishization of latin american women by basically every other group of people? Most people don't believe that I'm latina because of course the color of my skin, hair and eyes, but when I speak fluent Spanish or Portuguese, or listen to my corridos, nortenas or rancheras, I get straight up interrogated by whoever's around, sometimes there are sexual comments thrown around for no reason at all.

For example,  I mentioned once that I'm Mexican to a group of americans in one of my college classes ( I didn't pick the group), three black and one white guy, and they started saying really strange stuff like "oh yeah I could tell my your hips and lips", "you're pretty thick too!" "you seem like you got a temper." A lot of really corny and stupid shit like that. This is just one example of dozens I can recount, and all of my latina friends can relate. I also share this feeling with a lot of my asian girlfriends.

Now I know the term for this 'fetishization.' It makes a lot of sense, and it's what I see all over twitter and instagram with no provocation at all. How do you all feel about this? From, what I assume is, a largely male perspective.


************Paraguayans, can you help us enlighten us of what exactly is going on in your country at the moment? What are the people protesting about? If it's in regards to the handling of the pandemic: weren't Paraguay one of the best Latin Americans at tackling the pandemic at some point? What went wrong? How political are those protests, and what do they seek to achieve? Is there any hope for vaccination of the population in Paraguay?


************Can we talk about what's happening with Venezuelans in Northern Chile? In the last 2 weeks (or 10 days maybe), hundreds of Venezuelans have tried to enter Chile and this has overwhelmed small towns in Northern Chile.

************congratulations argentina. as a mexican, i‚Äôm happy for you guys!


************In Hollywood action/thriller movies, Russians or Germans tend to play bad guys, Asians almost always know martial arts, Latinos always have brown skin etc. What are some weird or stupid movie tropes in your country? Also doesn't have to include nationality, things like:

-Regions always have a certain aesthetic (Scenes in Mexico always have a green/brown tint, European areas are usually dense and urban but sophisticated, Japan and technology)

-Aliens always invade America

-Women that fight people always wear high heels

-Henchmen barely do anything to the main character


************What is something that is genuinely better in Latin America than in the rest of the world? I'll start by saying social culture

************When will people from the USA stop treating Latin America like we just discovered fire? I seriously am really interested in this sub since a lot of you have so many interesting points of view, and since we can see that, how come they haven‚Äôt realized that be even broke the language barrier? 
Was I too intense? Sorry. Just grab a book please.

Edit: I got tired of answering the same questions so, to clarify: it‚Äôs based on the US redditors who ask dumb questions almost repeatedly (seriously, you have the Internet to search the answers to your doubts if you don‚Äôt want a book).
Secondly, stop assuming my personality type is apathetic/superiority complex, and that I judge other countries or continents. 

Thank you.


************What is socially acceptable in your country that would be horrifying in the US? Or vice versa? 


************Is the world "gringo" used when referring to people from USA in your contry? Just curious

Bruh, I just noticed I wrote "world" instead of "word". Anyway, thanks for the replies, it looks like everyone but Argentina use it.

************Problems your country doesn't have but the US or other developed countries do Let me begin:

No one goes bankrupt due to medical bills here.


************What is you opinion on Christmas being so winter themed? Today while shopping for christmas stuff I realized how winter themed everything was while outside was like 32¬∞ degrees, it does not make any sense, all christmas decorations and clothes being all jackets for the cold, fake snow everywhere, snowflakes, yet everything is literally melting outside.

Now it is not the the end of the world or anything, I see it is even kinda funny how little correlation is, and we have some desert kinda vibe here too with the nacimientos that make more sense with the heat. But I wanted to read y'all opinion on this, I am interested knowing that most of the region, celebrates christmas in the heat.

If someone from a country where christmas is celebrated in winter want to comment it would be nice too, seeing y'all perspective on this.


************Raul Castro is stepping down as the head of the Cuban Communist Party. Cubans of r/asklatinamerica, what do you think about that? And what do you think about the future of the country?


************What kind of questions at this sub makes you roll your eyes? To me it's any question related to ancestry or ethnicity.


************In 2015 El Salvador had an homicide rate of 103 per 100,000 habitants. Today that is down to 7.8 per 100,000 but president Nayib Bukele did it by limiting constitutional rights. Would you support such an approach in your country if it was facing such a level of violence (see more below)? According to [this guy](https://twitter.com/feguz77/status/1622780483892396037), among the measures implemented by Bukele was that the police could arrest anyone they want for 15 days if they think he/she is suspicious.   Thousands have been arrested that way, and about a hundred have died in prison.


************Is it considered "Low class" or somehow bad to have an indigenous last name in your country? This comes from a colombian friend I met here in Madrid. He emigrated here a couple years ago and he always said his last name was "de Mendoza" but one day he told me it was actually **Yatari** (or something similar) de Mendoza but that he was used to only say the castillian one because he got bullied at school for having an indigenous sounding last name. One of his reasons to become a spaniard was so that he could change the order of his last names.


************Indigenous names that are widespread in your country? In Brazil its Kau√™, Iara, Moacir, Taynara, Kau√£, Mayara, Tain√°, Kauane, Ubirajara. I guess these are the most mainstream names that are indigenous brazilian


************What is the most annoying stereotype you think Hollywood (and in general, USA TV shows) says about Latinamerica? I was watching Better Call Saul and, besides that I think it is a really excelent series, they showed me again what, for me, is the most annoying stereotype shown in USA TV and movies: in Latinamerica there are *always* and **everywhere** chickens: I remember one of the Indiana Jones' movies where chickens were even at a Peruvian airport ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è


************How can you tell apart a USA raised Latinamerican person from a Latinamerican person? Would it be their woke opinions and their "latinx" usage?


************Hey guys, I've been learning Spanish for some time and I would appreciate it if anyone could tell me the meaning of these words that I think are slang and which places in south America use them, google was not my friend but I think some could be like Argentinian slang, tbh idfk che salamin, ub√≠cate, la mamerta, juno, dale, cuidala, pajera, also these words I saw someone use in a message talking to someone else so I apologize in advance if they are not nice words. The og message was "che salamin ub√≠cate que ni te juno pero si tamos hablando de la mamerta de tu vieja pajera si, es una arrastrada de porquer√≠a reventadita as√≠ que cu√≠dala m√°s dale" which i think i understand but still dont actually understand


************Who remembers the old Abecedario letters ‚Äúch‚Äù & ‚Äúll‚Äù? Growing up I remember being taught that these were also part of the alphabet, they were on the class books and awkwardly jammed into the songs. I know the RAE removed them but I was just curious about who had memories of learning about these d√≠grafos.


************FIFA is penalizing national soccer teams for homophobic chants.

[source](https://www.telemetro.com/deportes/panama-sancionado-cantos-discriminatorios-el-partido-mexico-n5561702)

I don't know much about soccer and I don't like it. However, it seems hypocrite to punish people for homophobic chants when you're organizing the World Cup in Qatar and the last one was in Russia.

************[MOD POST] We need to discuss agenda pushing. Okay, so let's talk about [Rule 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/asklatinamerica/about/rules/). of our beloved subreddit.

>4. No agenda pushing

>Try to remain as neutral as possible when asking a question. Do NOT submit questions that you already have an answer to, which is to say, do not be biased in the wording of your question. The point of asking is to hear what other perspectives have to say about the same issue.

I wrote this definition a little over two years ago. Unfortunately, recently we've had a lot of conflict in regards to this rule. The case is that a lot of people either 1) ignore / don't know of the existence of this rule or 2) don't understand what it means.

The idea behind this rule, essentially, is to prevent anyone from making people discuss what is an opinion of their own as a fact. Also, we do NOT want threads to take on a specific direction because of opinions that were written on the title of the post or in the body text. If OP is biased, so are going to be the answers. 

Posts, both in the title and in the body of text, should be **NEUTRAL**. No opinions shoehorned as facts are allowed. Avoid making claims when asking something in general, but if you feel it's necessary, then come up with either sources that back you up or an explanation in the body text to clarify what you mean, while remaining completely neutral. If people end up commenting in your post, "source?", that's a big red flag the post is breaking this rule. Let's see what this looks like in practical terms with a stupid example that I just came up with.

Question: 

- Brazilians, your country is a shithole. Why is that the case?

Obviously, a question of this type is not allowed under the guidance of rule 4. An OP in a question like this would be trying to insert an opinion of their own ("Brazil is a shithole") as a fact. No one can actually prove that's the case because a country being a "shithole" or not is a matter of perception. There's a LOT of middle way between this obvious example of rule-breaking question, and a question that would be able to stand in spite of making a certain claim, so obviously this is judged on a case-by-case basis. A question that would be permitted is this:

- Brazilians, do you consider life in your country to be of good quality?

And if there is a Brazilian user that responds by "no, I think it's a shithole", there'd be nothing wrong with that comment either. Since it's a comment, and the users were asked to give an opinion on the matter, there's nothing wrong with expressing how you feel about it, **in the comments**.

Here's another question that would be allowed to stand, for example:

- Venezuelans, your country had the [highest murder rate out of all Latin America in 2019](https://www.statista.com/statistics/947781/homicide-rates-latin-america-caribbean-country/#:~:text=Latin%20America%20%26%20the%20Caribbean%3A%20homicide%20rates%202019%2C%20by%20country,-Published%20by%20Marina&text=In%202019%2C%20the%20highest%20homicide,with%20a%20rate%20of%2041.2.). How does this affect your day-to-day life?

Another way to view this is: [fact] followed by [question] is allowed. [opinion] followed by [question] is not.

Here's another example. This question would be ideologically charged, and would make the thread take on a specific direction, which is undesirable.

- Cubans, how have you managed to survive a dictatorship that's been going on since the middle of the last century?

There would be so many ways to ask this question without assuming things first. Generally speaking, starting a quesiton with a presumption is a big NO-NO. You're not trying to convince people of a specific idea you have; rather, you're trying to understand more about a topic, or you want to hear other perspectives on an issue. You **MUST** leave your own ideas and perspectives behind when writing a question. Obviously we're not trying to censor anyone. You're more than free to discuss more about the topic in the comments. The issue we have is when the post starts off with a certain point of view. This sub is an **ASK** subreddit. The main goal here is to ask, not debate. Debating comes naturally, but shouldn't be the main focus of a question. 

Here's another example, just because I'm inspired today. 

- Religious sectors are growing across Latin America. How can we stop this threat?

This question would be taken down. OP starts off well: with a fact, religious groups are indeed growing. However, they then insert an opinion of their own: that is a threat. OP's assuming all users agree this is a threat to our region. This question would not only be removed for agenda pushing, it would also be a case of discrimination, which is also against our rules. **Please abstain completely from this type of question**. Here's a question that would be allowed to stand:

- Latin Americans, have you noticed any changes in society caused by a growth of religious groups in your countries?

You see, there's nothing wrong with this question at all. There's no malicious intent whatsoever. At most, the only thing OP is "assuming", is that there's been some kind of change, in which case you would anyways be able to answer: "actually, I haven't noticed much difference compared to 20 years ago".

Lastly but not least: before accusing mods of any wrongdoing, take a look at the question you typed in. No, we're no trying to conspire against any user. Mods are doing what's essentially unpaid work for the greater good of this space we all like to be in. Do we make mistakes sometimes? Absolutely. That doesn't mean we hold something against you. Take any action of ours that you feel was wrong to the modmail, and as always, **remain civil**

Think I've said enough on this topic. Feel free to comment saying if you disagree with anything I typed on this text.


************[Breaking News] Ecuador raided Mexico‚Äôs embassy, violating the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties and Mexico‚Äôs sovereignty. Is this Ecuador‚Äôs diplomatic downfall? Mexico is breaking off diplomatic ties with Ecuador after police broke into the Mexican embassy in Quito to arrest a former Ecuadorian vice president who has sought political asylum there. Just to show the magnitude of this offense, when Snowden looked for asylum in Russia‚Äôs embassy, the United States, which is arguably one of the most powerful militaries of the world did not invade Russia‚Äôs embassy to get one of their most wanted man in their history. 

Police broke into the external doors of the Mexican diplomatic headquarters in the Ecuadorian capital and entered the main patio to get Glas.

‚ÄúThis is not possible, it cannot be, this is crazy,‚Äù said Roberto Canseco, head of the Mexican consular section in the capital, Quito, told local press while standing outside the embassy. ‚ÄúI am very worried because they could kill him. There is no basis to do this, this is totally outside the norm.‚Äù

Defending its decision, Ecuador's presidency said in a statement: ‚ÄúEcuador is a sovereign nation and we are not going to allow any criminal to stay free.‚Äù

Alicia B√°rcena, Mexico's secretary of foreign relations, posted on X, formerly Twitter, that a number of diplomats suffered injuries during the break-in, adding that it violated the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations.

B√°rcena said that Mexico would take the case to the International Court of Justice ‚Äúto denounce Ecuador‚Äôs responsibility for violations of international law.‚Äù She also said Mexican diplomats were only waiting for the Ecuadorian government to offer the necessary guarantees for their return home.

Ecuador‚Äôs foreign ministry and Ecuador‚Äôs ministry of the interior did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

************Did you ever called your teacher "mam√°" by mistake? I am deeply sorry about my typo in the title, at first I wrote "Have you ever called..."


************In Uruguay, a professor was fined for Holocaust Denial. Do you think he deserved it? Do you think there should be laws like this in your country? [Profesor poste√≥ que el Holocausto es una "gran mentira", fue imputado por incitaci√≥n al odio y recibir√° una charla sobre el tema (elobservador.com.uy)](https://www.elobservador.com.uy/nota/profesor-posteo-que-el-holocausto-es-un-gran-mentira-fue-imputado-por-incitacion-al-odio-y-recibira-una-charla-sobre-el-tema-2021123111610)


************Forget the misery and corruption, you woke up tomorrow and Latin America is the world's richest region and we all are high income citizens. What's your main concern now? I am concerned about whether I should get a Nvidia RTX 3080 TI right now or wait a bit longer to see if Nvidia releases any new GPUs.


************The House of Commons has declared for the first time that genocide is taking place against China's Uyghurs. USA did so in January. Do you think your country will be soon to follow? 


************Why does Uruguay have a large amount of its citizens living in other countries if it has the one of best democratic systems in the Americas? Uruguay has about 18% of its population living in other countries.

[Source](https://datosmacro.expansion.com/demografia/migracion/emigracion/uruguay)

Usually emigration is seen as a failure by a country to retain its citizens that have to leave the country to look for better opportunities. It has been used to criticize both left-wing and right-wing policies before (Venezuela, Honduras, Mexico, Argentina, etc).

But it doesn't apply to Uruguay where there's a strong democracy and political stability.

It seems migration is a more complicated topic than we thought if we also consider that Ireland (a developed country) also has issues with brain drain.


************Do you think the internet and globalization have contributed to general unhappiness among Latin America's youth? I have noticed a recent uptick in "s√°quenme de Latinoam√©rica" posts around the internet. Part of it is of course the economic downturn as a result of the pandemic, but yesterday I was wondering whether it was also the internet's fault. Think about it, thanks to globalization people have access to internet like never before, and in there they are bombarded by posts that serve as constant reminders that people in the US and Europe live a better life. Part of it is illusory, of course, since we don't see the posts of the poor over there but the rich influencers who flex their wealth. But it also means the young are much more aware of disparities and prone to suffer for it. I've heard it's similar among young people in the US who see the life style of the rich kids and get depressed because they can't afford that.


************Is the Chilean Condorito cartoon recognized in the rest of Latin America? [Here](https://youtu.be/-SiJzYIIeDg) is an example. I hadn‚Äôt seen him before visiting Chile, but maybe I have been living under a rock.


************What's the relationship your country has with coffee? I'm from Brazil so coffee it's deeply connected in our culture since the colonization. Hell, when we say "breakfast" in portuguese, in a free translation, is "Morning coffee".

So, how you country treats coffee? Deeply cultural? Economic issue? Don't care much? Only in "Starbucks"?...


************Do you like your national anthem?   
I know most people aren't interested on anthems as a music genre, but I'm curious to know what do you think about your country's anthem.   

In my case, I'd say that I like the Chilean anthem, but I have to admit that there anthems that are much better, even in Latin America, like the Uruguayan anthem, that one sounds just amazing, I don't know, perhaps it is because of how many times I have listened to the Chilean anthem that I don't find it as good as others.

Edit: why I'm being downvoted? Did I say something wrong or anything?


************In average, would you say Latinos are more hygienic and cleaner than the rest of the world? Visited Europe last summer and people.... smelled.

Visited Asia and people... smelled.

Visited New York and people... smelled and the streets were so dirty. 

But, when I visit Latin American cities, everyone smells fresh and even I think they use a little too much cologne. 


************Can black people be called Gringos Me and my friend got into a minor argument debating if black people can be called gringos he thinks gringo only refers to white people In my opinion gringo is anyone that doesn't have Latino or Hispanic heritage what do you guys think

If its relevant for any reason Im cuban


************What is something that the majority of Reddit gets wrong about your country? As a Honduran, the majority of the people don't know a single thing about our country, but some think its a warzone and everyone is poor and everything is gross. They have a hard time understanding that it is a country of extreme inequality, so there's some really nice developed areas and its not just straight slums everywhere (though there's no denying lots of those exist). Americans don't tend to understand their involvement in why we got so poor, but that comes as no surprise. 

For those of you whose countries are a bit more well known, what is something that the Reddit consensus is wrong about? I'm particularly interested in hearing from Bolivians because their subreddit often gets brigaded by people who seem to think they know more than the Bolivians on there, but I'd like to hear from as many people from as many places as possible.


************If a war broke out in South America, whose fault do you think would be? 


************Why do so many Latin Americans end up moving to Spain even though the country has a huge unemployment problem? 


************Why is there so much hostility towards Americans of Latin American descent on this sub? I‚Äôve recently stumbled upon this sub, and looking through past posts it seems like there is a general hostile attitude towards Americans of Latin American descent, like they annoy you guys. Is there a reason for this?


************Ask about belize, and i answer. 


************Feliz 18th Sept a todos los Chilenos!!! To those with Chilean-born parents and living outside of the country (or even anyone for that matter), how did you react upon learning about the history behind the military coup? I‚Äôm an Australian-born with Chilean parents from both sides - I‚Äôm interested in hearing about everyone‚Äôs perspective on the topic, especially from those who also might‚Äôve been born in another country (or moved at a young age) but still grew up around the mix of said country as well as the Latin American culture.

I ask as I‚Äôve always sort of known about the history of Chile with brief context but have now recently sat down and properly educated myself by reading books, watching documentaries and asking Chileans first hand on their experiences during el Golpe. Safe to say that I still get angry and sad thinking about the cruel injustice that millions of people faced during that time.


************Brazil is one of the few countries that offer free school meals to all students. What's a wonderful thing about your country that few people notice? We in Brazil have the second largest free school lunch program in the world, second only to India. I'm not talking about giving food to students whose family income is below a certain amount, but all public school students have access to a meal. And this is not something that is talked about much among Brazilians, much less a reason for pride.  
  
What things happen in your country that you think are exemplary, but the general public doesn't notice?


************Are you for or against the Internationalization of the Amazon Region? South America is home to around 5% of the world population, yet contains a third of all freshwater on earth, not even including Chile and Argentina‚Äôs claims in Antartica. As climate change worsens, billions of humans across the world will have less access to water, while South America sits on the epicentre of the ‚Äúoil‚Äù of the 21st century. Colombia alone has more freshwater than the entirety of Europe sans Russia. Brazil has nearly triple Russia‚Äôs (2nd) freshwater. Biodiversity is starting to he seen as an economic benefit, aiding in the creation of pharmaceutical and scientific technologies. Countries sitting on the Amazon region are increasingly being deforested, so some foreign governments have proposed the concept of ‚ÄôInternationalization of the Amazon‚Äô, namely the French President Macron under that excuse.

While I, as a Latin American abhor the destruction of our beloved Amazon, I am vehemently opposed to such concept. US and European governments/corporations can exploit the global south and no one bats an eye, but God forbid us wanting half of our territory to belong to us alone. Also, water is a human right, but think of the destruction our ecosystems would go through if we were forced to export water for the global masses if it were to be internationalized. Our lifelines being decimated in order to quench billions in far away continents, with no economic retributions. If this were ever to be pressured by the international community, I wouldn‚Äôt doubt that leading to the formation of Union of Latin American countries with heavy military presence in the Amazon, Patagonia and eventually the Antarctic.

************Hello everyone from Suriname, Guyana, French Guyana and Trinidad y Tobago. I never hear much about you, how are you guys doing? I know some of you don't speak romance languages, but this might be the only sub where I can reach all of you. 


************[Meta] We reached 20.000 subscribers. Congrats to everyone! ü•≥ Nice to see the sub still growing strong after 1 year of questions

I am glad to see new faces from smaller countries. We now have multiple users from Central America, Haiti, and some Caribbean Islands ü•Ç. We even had a poster from the mythical Suriname(!)

Thanks to the Mods, to old and new users for keeping the sub enjoyable and intresting

************What are your thoughts on this video of Latinos taking a DNA test and questioning the results? Why do you think there seems to be an aversion to European heritage amongst US Latinos but European heritage isn't stigmatized in Latin America for the most part? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J49mV_lucl4&t

This video went viral a few months ago and in hit the frontpage in various subreddits.


************Why is Costa Rica such a stable democracy? Why makes the country of Costa Rica, preserve it's democratic institutions and maintain the necessary political stability in the face of democratic backlsiding, other countries in the continent have routinely suffered from?


************How LGBT friendly is your country? I see in studies and in rankings by actual LGBT couples countries like Argentina and Colombia rank higher than Finland and Denmark when it comes to gay friendliness.  


So is your country homophobic, neither or supportive?


************in your country are there still escaped slave communities? This is a controversial subject in Brazil. We still have quilombola communities today, descendants of slaves who fled during slavery. These communities are protected by the state and receive public money. they preserve the history of their ancestors.


************Do you feel that your country has a problem with colorism or light skin bias? Colorism is the discrimination based on skin tone, not race or ethnicity. I've read about this being a problem.in countries like India and South Korea where people try to bleach their skin. In the US for example, there have been occasions where movie directors feel paranoid of showing dark skin people in movies because they feel the movie won't make money. What do you think?

Here in Uruguay, people tend to deny the fact that we have a small but noticable black population and some seem to be embarrassed to have black people in their country.


************Luc√≠a Hiriart, the wife of Pinochet, has died. Chileans, what are your thoughts about this? 


************There are terms like ‚ÄúGerman efficiency‚Äù, ‚ÄúBritish humor‚Äù, or ‚ÄúCanadian politeness‚Äù. What is your nationality associated with? 


************Is Latinamerica the least dramatic region of them all? So, after wandering around subs dedicated to Europe, North America and the like... I thought: "Man, while all these guys are here fighting and taking charts out of nowhere with shitty statistics, we latinamericans are chilling at our homes, probably eating empanadas, watching streamers run to buy an elote and overall enjoying life."

I mean, sure, maybe these days have had a lot of political turmoil, sure there are migration issues and sure argentinians are arrogant after their Copa America winning (lol), but even so, we like them. The only times things get a lil bit messy is when football starts or when food is in discussion, but even then its all mostly in good faith (mostly, I've seen nasty stuff, specially in YouTube from all places).

That's how I raise my question here: Are we the least dramatic region, at least on the Internet? Although we have rivalries as any other country, do we mostly get along?


************Do you use under-the-table, unofficial services? I am a US citizen in Brazil. I live in the countryside. One of the things I love most about living here, is under-the-table services. Maybe this is not the right word, so let me give some examples. I was doing some yard work in my front yard, and an older gentleman saw me and said he could do this work for me. He quoted me a fair price and the next day, he came over and cleaned up my entire front and back yard. He did an amazing job. Another example: in this small town, there is no Uber. But if we want to go to the next city or even to the airport in the next state, we can kind of let it be known, and we can ALWAYS count on finding someone with a car to contact us, who will negotiate a good price to drive us. 

Do you use services like this?

************Why do we have mods from the US and European countries in this subreddit? Is this what digital neo-colonialism looks like? I just noticed that half of the moderators here are europeans and US americans (also known as united-statians). I feel like we try hard to be independent but as always, we come under some type of foreign oversight. Damn, I guess this shit never really ended, huh?

************Have Latam folks studying in the US encountered tension with US Latinos? I'm a Latin American grad student in the US and I recently did a guest talk about my research in front of a group of undergrads. Overall, it was a great experience. However, 2/3rds into the presentation, a US Latina student started asking me pretty personal questions, including stuff about my educational background. Then she confronted me, telling me "not everyone had the same opportunities as you." I'm not upset at all (I get it, actually), but I was taken aback. Has anyone else had interactions like this here in the States?

************Help for uruguayan collective institution \[posting this with previous permission from mods\]

Hi, y'all. I'm from Uruguay and I'm a part of a collective of uruguayan artisans, it is an association that is over 40 years old, dedicated to sell arts and crafts of local artisans, located in the city of Colonia. This is a very tourism-dependent city, so you can imagine we are having a very hard time, as the pandemic is currently hitting our country harder than ever. More details are in the link below, but in resume we are looking for donations that allow this place to keep existing and save some jobs. If you've ever been here, or planning to do it some day, you wont regret it, and coffe (or mate) is on me. Thank you all, and please don't downvote.

************Do you think drugs legalization could reduce drastically the homicide rates in latin america to European levels? 


************Spanish speaker of South America: do you think european Spanish is weird/funny just like we brazilian think european Portuguese is? I'm pretty sure most of brazilian people who don't have much contact with the european Portuguese accent think it's weird/funny (or even silly). Do you guys think the same about the Spanish spoke in Spain?


************Is sports betting common in your country? Hey everyone,

Is sports betting common in your country like it is everywhere in the US?

Personally I use Stake and have won like $44k in the last year with NBA and soccer bets. Crazy I know.

In the US, it's everywhere, from TV ads to online platforms. Just curious how widespread it is in Latin America. Are there any popular local betting sites or apps? Is it regulated by the government, or is it more of an underground thing? 

Also, how do people generally view sports betting in your country? Is it seen as a fun pastime, a serious gambling problem, or something in between?

Would love to hear your thoughts and experiences!

Thanks!


************Do immigrants from other latam countries suffer discrimination in your country? Here in Brazil, they do...

Bolivians will often be bad treated while on stores, restaurants, etc. Same applies to haitians. Ive worked in shopping mall for a great time so i pretty much know.

Venezuelans i havent yet met any. But they are probably only a few here so no "discrimination sense" was created for them.

What about ur country?

************If I wanted to evacuate from Russia to LatAm, where would you recommend me to? Reconsidering all my plans for life because president here went nuts completely/greatly overestimated his capabilities. Most people here have some survivalist vibes. I'm somewhat on the same side with them, 20-40% inflation with a marked decrease of life quality is both manageable and absolutely inevitable at this point, but what if things go far worse? Nearly half of my savings are gone with the stock crush, currently I have about 2000$ in USD, US stocks and maybe up to another 2000$ potentially (relatives owing me and/or we'll sell some land). Switching jobs at moment and will be saving more, while it remains possible at all.

My question is, what countries in Latin America are realistic for someone like me? 25M, paramedical degree which'll very likely serve as useless paper anywhere outside of CIS countries, some english knowledge and soul sucking desire to learn spanish or less preferably PT (way less options?) while I still stay here. Switching into IT might be necessary, but sounds too difficult at this point already. Will be thinking about it as well.

I have several buddies in Puebla, GDL but I didn't inform them (yet?) and it still doesn't clarify anything for now.

Not asking on IWO yet as I don't feel confident or wasn't preparing for emigration for many years beforehand.

************Do spanish speaking countries use (brazilian) portuguese sentences randomly on phrases? Recently I've noticed that here we Brazil some people just toss random sentences in spanish in a conversation. Usually it's something very simple like "no lo s√©", "no conozco", "no comprendo" and stuff like that.

It's not like every other sentence and not nearly everyone, of course, but it's frequent enough that kind of caught my attention.  


Edit: None of the people that I've heard doing that actually speaks spanish

************Does racism happen amongst Latinos? How and for what reasons? I'm a Filipino who studies and loves the history of my country. 

Knowing the history, I opted to find out what remains common between Latin America and the Philippines. 
In my country, there is racism and discrimination between ethnic groups, as well as between the remnants of the insulares and mestizos. The old Spanish colonial caste system had something to do with this, or so we are taught. Skin color has a lot to do with it as well. 

I hope I am not being intrusive in your space. 

Thank you.

************Do you feel a form "escapist guilt" when thinking about moving/ move to another nation to look for a higher standard of life? I am quite aware I am uncommon in this, but I'd like to know if I'm alone in sometimes feeling like I'm contributing to some sort of "brain-drain" or something like that when I think of moving to somewhere like Canada or Western Europe to complete/ after my studies to see if I can find myself better opportunities than I would find in the brazilian job market in my field.

 I love my country, and sometimes I believe that I should stay to attempt to better it somehow, but then I think it's practically impossible for me to do so as an individual unless I decide to strive for some sort of political position, which I am quite sure I couldn't enter that sort of "society" even if I want to. But again, if everyone that could gain an upper education left the country and felt the same way, that wouldn't be good, right?

Am I alone in being kinda conflicted on this?

In my case is my girlfriend, her nickname is Negrita.


************what‚Äôs something that americans/europeans often say about latin america that you find offensive?  i included europeans because they are very racist, but they pretend to be more progressive than americans.

i‚Äôll go first. there aren‚Äôt stereotypes specifically about nigeria that i‚Äôve heard from americans or europeans (except for scams, but i find it funny). but talking about stereotypes about africa:

1. we‚Äôre all uniformly poor, starving & underdeveloped. yeah, africa is the most underdeveloped continent in the world. but there are also many areas that are developing fast & areas that are already quite developed. 

2. we‚Äôre always at war. some areas are, indeed. but others have been in peace for years. we‚Äôre not a bunch of savages that like to murder each other for sport.

this is not specifically about africa, but another thing i‚Äôm becoming tired of seeing: europeans justifying their own racism by bringing up ethnic conflicts in africa/latin america/asia. i‚Äôve seen it countless times. 

yeah, my country got significant ethnic conflicts. what does this have to do with me (a member of the diaspora) being discriminated in europe? do i deserve discrimination because other people that share my nationality are racist/xenophobic? it‚Äôs something i‚Äôve been seeing more often lately. it seems like everyone in europe is an expert on global south racism! 


************What are the most outrageous/outrageously funny headlines that a mainstream news outlet has published in your countries? I just saw that Cronica (which is well known in Argentina for having the most ridiculous and often offensive headlines such as "[2 people and 1 Bolivian dead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0SE0O-mJA0)") used the phrase "[Live: Last Season of Vikings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=57pELwqOzoU&t=413s)" to refer to yesterday's events in the US.

************What is awesome in your country that is taken for granted? For example, in Buenos Aires blossoming starts around mid-August and just started finishing now. That's seven months of constant blossoming. In my hometown, St. Petersburg, we only have one such month. Even my wife, who was born in a rather southern town  Vinnytsia says they only had 2 months of flowers around. And here it is freaking 7! 

Yet I have never heard of BA being promoted like "the city of constant spring" or something. People around don't even know how strange and amazing it is. Kinda elephant in the room. Any more such examples?


************What's the craziest thing a president in your country has ever said or announced? President Carlos Menem [announced spaceflights](https://youtube.com/watch?v=IkWnECZQZyk) in a public event in 1996!

************I feel like Brazil is living its lowest point since I was born (96). Would you say the same for your country in the present moment? The cost of living has rised like crazy. Inflation is going wild and the number of people living in misery is increasing every day.  We have a very high unemployment rate too at the moment.

Minimum wage is far from being enough for one to live decently. We also have one of the most expensive fuel prices in the world. I mean... I haven't even mentioned things like the tragic loss of hundreds of thousands lives in the pandemic.

I could mention many other things...

Would you say the feeling for your country is the same right now?

A friend of mine told me she was straight groped in public while walking down Buenos Aires by a total stranger and when she turned around to confront him she couldn‚Äôt tell who‚Äôd done it. 

I‚Äôd rather not go into rape in this thread as much as focus on these smaller yet disgusting offenses. 

Is this common?


************What is the most elitist/classist thing you've experienced? We often talk about how bad classism/elitism is within Latin America, so I would like to chronicle some examples. 

My most ridiculous examples of elitism was when an associate said that nurses should become doctors if they want to be taken seriously. I also had someone say that people should stop complaining about corruption and just enter (high) government roles themselves if they wanted change.


************Did you know that 47% of venezuelans support a military intervention to get Maduro out? Source: https://twitter.com/Meganalisis/status/1307228640569176064?s=09

What's your opinion on this?


************Latin Americans, in your country / region, is it comon the tought that "we are more hygienic than the average European / North American"? In Brazil, it seems like part of common-sense that we are more hygienic than the average European or North American.

Obviously, there are people in Brazil (as in any part of the world) with bad hygienic habits.

But today, having met many Brazilians from different regions, and having met a bunch of people from different nationalities (since i live in europe today), it seems true in most casese.  


I don't mean to judge anyone, but Italians, Germans and North Amerticans i've met were kind of shocked by the cultural habit of showering twice a day, even in the winter.

Or also by habits like bringing your toothbrush to the office, for brushing your teeth after lunch.

I would like to know if these kind of habit and cultural elements are similar in other nations around Latin America.


************We've got about 25 less responses on the subreddit census than last year, even though the sub is double the size. Got 5-10 minutes? Check it out. **Edit: Census is now closed with ~1100 responses**

It'll close in the next two days. I know there's a pinned post but people claim not to see it, strangely enough.

Sorry to be spammy!

Just to add, if you think it's not secure, or a waste of time, or just stupid, just, like, don't do it. It's totally a reasonable thing to think and do.


************does your country have some kind of national debate that cant be solved? in brazil we have had this debate for ages about whether or not Capitu cheated on Bentinho, two characters from *Dom Casmurro*. i personally think she chated on him


************Do women in your country change their last name after getting married? I recently read an AITA post where people called a woman (from the US) who didn't want to change her last name after getting married "progressive". I found this kinda cringy to be honest since this is not the norm at all here, so it got me thinking. What is normal in your country?


************How differently do you think this subreddit would be if it didn't mostly consist of Argentines and Brazilians? According the the last census, these two are most prevalent nationalities. How do you feel about this?

What would the sub be like if it had more Mexicans or Colombians for example?


************Does it bother you how the world refer to USA as America? I know this a kind of old discussion, but i always hear different opinions about it. Does this use of the word make invisible the rest of the continent or is just the only way to refer to people from United States?


************Have you ever had Inca Kola? If so, what do you think about it? ü•§üáµüá™


************Is Chile the England of South America in terms of rooting for in sports? I mean Europe tend to to "celebrate" when England lose, mostly in Football, and If I'm not wrong Chileans usually root for England but in South America everyone celebrates when Chile lose, again mostly in football.

Is that true? Or am I so far from the truth

&#x200B;

Edit: Ok, apparently it's Argentina, did not expect that.

Edit 2: Jesus these comments are hilarious, can't stop laughing.

Edit 3: The chileans in this sub being crying of happiness right now like "They love us, they actually love us "


************What aspect about your country makes you cringe? 


************Chileans: how do you feel today? Any reflection? 


************Why are Mexican players so bad despite they being a football nation with the second largest population in Latin America? Shouldn't Mexican players be at the level of Argentina or Brazil?

Or football is not that popular in M√©xico as it is in South America?


************Most gringo post of the year? https://www.reddit.com/r/asklatinamerica/comments/kkt30u/most_gringo_post_of_the_year/

Re-posting for an update of this question, sorry if was already answered last year


************Do you think the Queen‚Äôs death will have an impact in Latin America? So the Queen has just died. (And she died in Scotlandüò±.)

Do you think this will have an impact in Latin America? I personally wonder if it might cause the end of the Commonwealth. (It‚Äôs an outdated idea anyway‚Ä¶.)

Edit: I'm trying to reply to comments, but I can't seem to post them.... I'll try again later lol.

Edit 2: Still not working, but I will reply here to a few questions:

\-Yes, the national anthem changes to God Save the King. (It changed to God Save the Queen when she became Queen.)

\-The monarchy is pretty unpopular in Scotland. Not sure I'd have a lot of luck finding anyone who supports them. (Even fewer now that the Queen is gone.)

\-Argentina, I hadn't heard of your Queen Mirtha before, but thanks for explaining who she is.

\-Keith Richards won't be next, he is indestructible, he fell out of a tree and survived lol.

Edit 3: The powers of Reddit have been returned. I can reply now....


************RTVE (Radiotelevisi√≥n Espa√±ola) has announced that they want to organize a hispanic version of Eurovision called "Hispavisi√≥n". What do you think about this? They would organize the contest in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia in 2023 and every hispanic country would send a song to represent them. They also want to invite Brazil and Portugal.

************What do you think of people who say "I'm not racist I'm from latin america" or "I'm not white I'm latino"? I've gotten into an argument with a white girl from mexico who said she wasn't racist cause she was mexican (she was defending a black guy getting killed by police). Funny thing was I never called her racist and I told her she is still white, in fact my skin is brown and I still call myself white.

I've also heard Christina Aguilera say " "I am Ecuadorian but people felt so safe passing me off as a skinny, blue-eyed white girl. " [https://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/christina-aguilera-fat-girl-article-1.1171905](https://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/christina-aguilera-fat-girl-article-1.1171905)


************Are you still using WhatsApp? Are most people in your country using WhatsApp? I know there was a lot of controversy regarding their new policies lately and I‚Äôve been reluctant to update my app but I see a lot of people still using it.


************Did the 19 Venezuelans that drowned while going on rafts to Trinidad make the news in your country? 


************Do your country have/had its own endless telenovela? Here in Chile we have Verdades Ocultas, a telenovela that has been on air since 2017 and that has just released its episode number 734 two days ago (the equivalent of 2 entire years and 4 days). And it seems that the production still have no plans to end the drama yet, making it the longest chilean teleserie.

I know cases like "La Rosa de Guadalupe" that has more than +1400 episodes or "El secreto del Puente Viejo" with a total of 2.324 episodes but no more than that.

So I ask you guys, do your country have/had an endless telenovela?


************Making your nationality your whole personality  This is probably a common occurrence in every country with a significant amount of people living abroad, but seeing many people from my country doing it, just makes me cringe. 
I know a woman who has always been pretty normal, but since she moved to Canada she's literally obsessed with the fact that she's Mexican. You know, always making comments and posting about how she's so mexican. Worst part of all is that this "being so mexican" is a cartoon identity to seek for validation with her foreign friends. Of course this includes joking about stereotypes like we jumping the wall, being alcoholic, etc. 
Also, most countries in the world are pretty much the same, so this whole "I'm from X so i act a certain way" is just nonsense. Wow, you come from a country where people loves music, parties is family oriented and there's crime, you're so special. 


************What non-Latino famous person surprised you with their impeccable Spanish, French or Portuguese? 


************Non-brazilians, do you have any opinions on the result of brazil‚Äôs presidential election? Or you just don‚Äôt care? I, for one welcome my new squid overlordü•≥ü•≥


************the European Union (EU) is bullying Uruguay and Panama (unknown if it's happening in other Latin American countries) because these countries don't charge tax on foreign income. What do you think of this? to me this is imperialism at its best. Not even the US is demanding something like this. Panama and Uruguay are both small countries that do this to attract investment. Basically, you don't have to pay income tax for foreign income (not earned inside the country) and the EU wants them to change that.

I am just going to say a phrase in Spanish that I heard in Libertarian circles: *si hay para√≠sos fiscales es porque hay infiernos fiscales*


************What depresses you the most about your country? For me it's the seemingly never-ending ignorance we have as a society, believing that we're better than everyone else when in reality we're pathetic, and this also involves politics, believing that politicians have any good intentions and always settling for the lesser evil than trying to achieve change.


************Do most of the Latin Americans in this subreddit live somewhere in Latin America? Just curious. Greetings from a chicano. 


************Do you have a Latin American celebrity crush? If so, who is it? I think Natalia Lafourcade is beautiful inside and out ü•∞

Edit: I just remembered I fell hard for K√©fera Buchmann from the Brazilian show Ninguem t√° olhando on Netflix

Edit #2: oh and Greeicy Rendon

Edit #3: Gael Garcia Bernal makes my heart beat fast

Edit #4: 69 likes. Nice


************What can Guatemala do to become Guatebuena or even Guatebuen√≠sima? 


************Are there any shows that are much more popular in your country than the country where the show was produced? Everybody hates Chris was a mild success in USA but it is insanely popular here in Brazil, it is the most popular foreign TV series by far, only rivalled with Chaves (El Chavo del Ocho)

The show still has a massive TV ratings despite having only 4 seasons and being broadcasted since the mid 00's and in every post made by an actor from the show it is filled with Brazilians commenting punchlines from the TV show.


************Why does Argentina have so many political parties? I don't understand it. Not even Chile has the amount of Political parties Argentina has, and Chile has **a lot** as well? 

The main difference between these is that every Chilean party seems to represent as slightly different ideology while every Argentine party (within the same coalition) seems to have the same ideology.

This is especially true in the Frente de Todos coalition which bands together 20 parties 7 of which describe themselves as Kirchenerist.


************Do you know Xuxa? How big was in your country? We all know how Chavo is/was huge here, but how about [Xuxa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Show_de_Xuxa).

Xuxa was a huge star during the 90's in Argentina. I used to watch her show when I was a kid. Even [barrabravas sang Ilari√™](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R77_28DEJE8). 

I'm pretty sure that in Brazil she was big as well, is she still relevant today?

How about the rest of latinamerica? Do you know her? Was she big?


************In your countries, do you eat twelve grapes on New Year's Eve as in Spain? [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve\_Grapes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve_Grapes)


************I've heard from here (and other places) that ‚ÄûAmerica‚Äú is prefered to ,‚Äûthe Americas‚Äú in Latam. Could y'all please elaborate on why? For context, I'm from Australia, and have always been taught a distinction between North and South America.

The first time I recall seeing that America should be considered one continent was here, but I've seen it elsewhere since, mostly from ‚ÄûSouth America‚Äú. 

Personally I can empathise with the view that it should be viewed as one. The entire... landmass, I'll say, was *heavily* influenced by European colonialism, and does have lots in common. However, there is obvious linguistic (and my instinct is to say cultural, but I honestly don't think I'm informed enough to say so) differences. 

I'd just like to hear opinions on whether the landmass should be considered one, and why or why not.


************People from the entire landmass of Latinoamerica what is your opinion on my random neighbourhood in a shithole town in the middle of nowhere Romania?

************Have you ever experienced racism in a foreign land? Primero, feliz navidad! que la hayan pasado todos muy bien

Okay, now in engish...I was just watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cc1GhI1Dwyc) about a Korean girl being racially abused in germany. It blew my mind, because I¬¥ve never experienced anything like that... have you ever had to experience something similar?

I've only been once to the US, and it was fine for me, I am your typical "trigue√±o, morenito" guy, but I was in a very diverse state too, the year I lived there was fine, I was always treated with respect...

EDIT: Wow, I wrote this in the morning and was not expecting so many responses, I was expecting just a few, sorry if I can't answer them all


************Pope Francis has shocked the world by supporting same-sex civil unions. Was this news in your country? How did people react? [Source - Portuguese](https://brasil.elpais.com/sociedade/2020-10-21/papa-francisco-apoia-uniao-civil-entre-homossexuais.html)

************What latin american stereotype you cannot consciously stop believing To me, every colombian guy is 10/10 handsome - Maluma/James Rodriguez level or up. Reason  can't convince me otherwise even when reality shows the truth.


************Do you think Europeans should pay "reparations" to the nations they colonized? 


************Did you have a misconception about how mexicans look because of their telenovelas ? When I was younger , Mexican soap operas were huge in my country (morocco), and up until 2 years ago i always thought mexicans are all tall and white... I was really shoked to learn that whites are very small minority in the country.

Did you guys felt the same way?


************Feliz Natal! Feliz Navidad! Joyeux N√∂el! Merry Christmas! Now go eat up that turkey and celebrate with your family instead of being on reddit, man.


************Negative US influence on food habits regarding vegetables. Do you feel like the portrayal of vegetables is US media is influencing or will negatively influence the eating habits in your respective countries?

I lived most of my life in Guatemala and vegetables are a huge part of my meals. I don't feel like I need to make an effort on including them, rather they come naturally. As a kid I used to be shocked by how US kids would react so bad to vegetables, so little me would just categorize the as being bad and misbehaved kids.

Edit: after reading some comments and doing some research of my own, it seems that US influence comes from US junk food targeting poor people, not neccesarilly from my initial hipothesis. Can we all ban concentrated corn syrup?


************Japan has suffered just 18 covid deaths per million people, by far the lowest in the G7, without mass testing or strict lock downs. How do you think they achieved this? 


************In your country, at what age is it common to leave your parent¬¥s house? In the US for instance, people ussually leave their houses as soon as they finish school (from what I¬¥ve seen ofc), even though they clearly still depend on them, to pay their college dorms and stuff.

Traditionally, In colombia, I¬¥d think is after the person gets married, I¬¥d think this is still the case in rural areas (although I¬¥m not sure at all). But more recently in the cities I think is after the person gets a job that allows them to pay rent in a small apartment (sometimes even if you win a salary and depend almost entirely on your own, you sill live with them, and pay a part of the bills or buy part of the food)


************Is it true that Argentina is the most resented nation in Latin America? I have a few friends from Mexico and Cuba who say that Argentinians are the most hated people in Latin America. They themselves admitted they don‚Äôt like Argentinians too, but couldn‚Äôt give me a reason why. When I‚Äôve asked my friend from Brazil about this, she had no idea what I was talking about. 

Is the resentment an actual thing? If so, what are the reasons for it?


************I‚Äôm not Latino. I was goofing off at work with my work best friend who is Latina (as we always do) and I swept a broom around her feet‚Ä¶ She leapt backwards and was ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt do that!‚Äù We‚Äôve known each other for years, but I hadn‚Äôt ever seen her react like that to anything.

So she tells me about a superstition I‚Äôd never heard before, in which sweeping under someone‚Äôs feet (or on or around them) is not only terrible bad luck but also means not ever being married.

I curious about two things:

1) How widely known is this? For reference, we both were born and still live in the western US

2) What could I do for her tomorrow to let her know that I want to rectify my mistake?

Thanks r/asklatinamerica,

Sincerely
A gay best work friend who done fucked up

Edit: removed my ethnicity because it might spark conversation off-topic. I only ask because I‚Äôm curious about the superstition itself which seems to be only prevalent (if at all) in the Latin American cultures.


************Why a lot of latin americans that move to the USA apparently tend to be more conservative than the ones moving to other places? I personally know many latin americans who have moved to different parts of the world, but something that really makes me curious is the different mindset of many of the ones who move to the USA compared to the ones that go to Europe or other places.

Ive seen that Latin americans that move to the USA tend to be more conservatives than usual, they have more strict family values, usually they vote for republicans, more religious, anti LGBTQ, and in some cases they can fall in some bigot behaviors. This is particularly common with cubans, venezuelans, colombians, dominicans and mexicans that move to USA, let alone the ones who live in states like Florida or Texas

On the other hand, many latin americans that move to Europe for example, tend to be more "liberal" and open minded for lack of better word.

This is something that ive seen for quite some time now, and im just kinda curious.


************So which country in Latin America has the worst human rights cases? 


************what is the most ignorant gringo shit you've heard about you country? 


************Hey Uruguay, Argentina, Paraguay, and South Bolivia: you guys ready for the huge mass of Polar wind coming this week? I don't know how much it affects Chile, tbh, since you guys are very high up, but feel free to talk as well.   


I'm in an area that will be affected, and although I like the cold, I'm worried about people living in the streets and food production overall. 


************Is it common knowledge that Spain is a monarchy? Came to my mind the other day that while meeting two newly arrived inmigrants (friends of a friend) some time ago (pre-covid) they were surprised by this fact. were they just ignorant? or it is just a thing never discussed or seen in your country?

Not trying to hurt anyone so lets keep it civil. I'm just curious


************Venezuelans outside Venezuela, do you like where you currently are, would you like to go back? I recently had a short conversation with another Venezuelan living in Argentina and I was shocked to hear that they wanted to go back, claiming she was sick of living here and claiming that people in Venezuela where having a better time than us, going to the beach whenever they wanted and whatnot. So, now I'm curious, do you like where you are now, are you desperate to go back to Venezuela?


************What are some cute native animals from your country? In Chile we have the [pud√∫](https://www.especiesendemicas.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/queens-zoo-pudu.jpg), [hui√±a](https://felinosdeargentina.com.ar/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/gato-huina-frente.jpg), [monito del monte](https://fundacionhuilohuilo.org/wp-content/uploads/DSCN4469.jpg) and [huill√≠n](https://laderasur.com/content/uploads/2020/05/huillin1.jpg), just to name a few.


************A Brazilian team became the worlds champion in Valorant, this is a huge title for Brazil and Latam (our in game leader is argentinian), how do you feel about it? 


************Ladino language is a Spanish origin language spoken by some Jews and some non-Muslim people in Turkey. Do you understand what you think about this language? I leave some examples sample text: Djoha kaminando i vino un ombre ke le demando: Musyu, ke oras son? Djoha lo miro de arriva fin abasho i no le dio repuesta. Kurriyo el ombre detras de Djoha: Pardon, Musyu, de ke no me dizes ke oras son? Djoha le disho: Se yo te disher ke oras son, me vas a demandar komo esto?!

************Mar√≠lia Mendon√ßa, one of the most famous singers of the sertanejo universit√°rio genre in brazil right now has died in a plane accident at the age of 26. Brazilians, what are your thoughts? Foreigners, did you know her or listen to any of her songs? Mar√≠lia became really famous in the sertanejo univers√°rio scenario at the early age of 19, being one of the most famous singers in brazil right now. She [died today](https://twitter.com/folha/status/1456728214240432129?t=edhHpNGbNb6xiyHfaiw0ag&s=19) in a plane accident. During the early pandemic her livestreams in youtube became one of the most watched of all time, with the whole country watching her perfomances at home, what are your thoughts? non-brazilians, is sertanejo listened to in your country?

Honorable mentions: Cuando pase el temblor, La c√©lula que explota, Tempo Perdido by Legi√£o Urbana (I listened to this just recently to make this post more accurate, but easily could be in my top ten).

Which are your fav songs?


************Why is Latin America stereotyped as being "conservative and traditional"? I find it to be a weird and out of touch perception of what the region is like overall. 

Every country is different of course. But Latin America is easily the most progressive region of the developing world.

People would be surprised at how many countries gay marriage is now legal in. 

Mexico just elected a female Socialist Jew as president, which would never happen in the US or even much of Europe. 




************Why is everyone so friendly to me with my limited Spanish? Hello, I am from the USA and just got back from a week and a half trip to Argentina. While the bulk of my trip was in Buenos Aires I did have the chance to see S√£o Paulo for 24 hours and also a day affair in Uruguay (Colonia). 

This was by far one of the most unique and warmest holidays I‚Äôve had. I‚Äôve been to 25 countries before this and adding these three countries on my belt was worth it. 

I speak English and French (B1 level) while my Spanish is only greetings and numbers. 

I have visited both Quebec and France multiple times and speaking French at a higher level made them either frustrated or just revert back to English. 

In Argentina I found everyone was willing to ask personal-friendly questions to the point it made me feel they had interest. This wasn‚Äôt just with Argentinians who I know are very talkative (so am I) but also Venezuelans in the Ubers and Brazilians. Maybe I‚Äôve visited so many places that are considered ‚Äúcold‚Äù that I wasn‚Äôt ready for the Latin warmth.

At the bank when I tried to ask for larger bills a handsome man who spoke English took some time to help me.

At the Teateo Colon I asked if I could take pictures inside the place while it was late and I didn‚Äôt have a reservation - he let me in for free and told me to enjoy the show. 

When I was getting dinner I sat next to two guys who were big into techno. They overheard as I was telling the waitnress I was from Detroit and come to find out their friend (who was somewhat a well known guy in the techno scene in Buenos Aires) is traveling to Detroit to ride in a Maserati and see techno shows. At 3am these guy got me in the vip section of the club. 

I could say more stories but in general I found so much warmth and love from this trip I want to come back as soon as I can - next time with more profficiency in my Spanish. 

I feel like the biggest thing I can take away from this trip is how we‚Äôre all American. I knew this before the trip (being that America is an entire continent) but as I explained how I knew this to locals or even my Brazilian friend they automatically lit up and I could see they viewed me with value.

************Why are so many latins supporting Russia? I don't know if you've noticed, but every time I click on a video about the current situation in Ukraine, half of the comments are about how Russia has the right to invade Ukraine and that the US or NATO/OTAN is the real threath  

I also see some people saying that Mexico could get back the territories they lost in the 19 century if it supports Russia, which is just stupid (although i dont known if its just a joke or something serious)

Of course you have the typical "viva la madre rusia" comments but i dont know why out of all places, latinamerica has so many people defending russia 

It also seens like many of these comments are plagued with conspiracy theories about the US "planning" this war since the beggining or something 

Its not that im against people being against the US or NATO/OTAN, but im just confused about this

************What innocent opinion divides the population in two camps? I saw this topic on r/AskEurope and instantly reminded me about the word for "cookie" in Brazilian Portuguese could be mean "Bolacha" or "Biscoito" and that completely divides the population. 

In one side, people who defeat the real way to call cookies is "Biscoito" because every brands uses that on the packages and people who defeat "Bolacha" cause "Biscoito" is just a layer of the cookie. By the way, the world "Bolacha" could also mean "slap in the face" haha.

I want to hear from you folks, what innocent opinion divides your country?

************spanish speakers, do you really use "¬ø" ? 


************Why do so many Latinos still act as if racism isn't a thing in our countries? I've seen many posts here, on r/Latam, and conversations irl where Latinos act like their country has no racism whatsoever and as if it's truly only an American/gringo thing. Just because people choose not to talk about it doesn't mean it doesn't exist when currently (and historically) darker-skinned latinos from all over Latam are generally of lower economic status, have less opportunities, and many primarily black/Caribbean towns and cities are usually much less developed and poorer. While light-skinned Latinos are seen owning businesses, in better paying jobs, better housing, with more college education, all over tv/film in Latam, etc. etc. 

While talking about racism/race may be more of an American thing I think we just have a habit of creating terminology for issues that are historically swept under the rug in our own countries. And I think we SHOULD talk about it more and accept our history of racism rather than just acting like it doesn't exist and our countries are these racism-free paradises where everyone is treated equally. /Endrant

************Foreigners (meaning, non-Latin Americans) who are living in our region, what is your story? What motivated you to settle here? How did you get here? How do you like it? Are you planning to stay? 


************Do your countries also use Venezuela as a reference for what you don‚Äôt want your country to turn into? First off, I don‚Äôt mean to be rude to any Venezuelans, I know what you‚Äôre going trough is rough enough already.
But curiosity got me asking, cause here in Mexico you tend to hear people saying we‚Äôll become North Venezuela and stuff like that with hyperinflation as such (I won‚Äôt dive into the details cause politics), so I mainly wanted te see if this is a Mexico only thing, or a whole Latin America thing

************What nationalities (or types of people within a nationality) tend to be the most annoying or cringiest on the Internet? In my experience, Canadians outside of Quebec tend to be super arrogant. Their whole identity boils down to not being American. Most have a weird obsession with Cuba for some reason. Irl, Canadians are normal but on the Internet they rub me the wrong way. Turks are very weird with their nationalism.

From Latin America, I feel that Dominicans and us Puerto Ricans are very cringe with the whole taino thing. 

Also, there is a subset of Colombians and Mexicans that are very pretentious when it comes to linguistics. They have this moronic idea that they have the most ''neutral'' accent even though in linguistics that doesn't make sense. Thankfully they're a minority and most are actually nice.

Honorable mentions: 90% of Caribbean Hispanics that end up living in Spain or Miami. They act like they live in the pinnacle of civilization. Instagram is filled with them.


************The general assembly has once again voted for ending the Cuban embargo with only the USA and Israel voting against lifting the embargo. What do you think about it? Source: https://news.un.org/es/story/2021/06/1493662


************Are there Motels in your country? In Brazil, a Motel is what in other places is called a "love hotel": a place that rents rooms for 2 hours or more, so that people can go have sex. They are quite mainstream in Brazil, with ads on TV and there is no attempt to pretend they serve any other function (although sometimes people actually stay there to, you know, sleep). I know they are not common in the US, but I wonder how it's like in other countries.


************Do brazilians enjoy spanish memes as much as we enjoy brazilian memes? Just in case, I mean spanish as in memes in spanish, not like... memes from Spain(?)

This is a known fact on twitter, people love brazilians memes bc the portuguese just makes it 10√ó funnier for some reason.
I've seen mostly argentinians and mexicans thinking like this but I'm sure the rest of latin america agrees, but I don't know how brazilians feel about this. 

There are many iconic ones like the twitter interaction about the panetone or the sopra mais forte filho da p*ta.

Did you know this? Do you guys even notice spanish memes or do you not care for them? Are they common? Do you find them funny at all? Does spanish sounds as funny as portuguese sounds for us for some reason?



************Can I share a free historical game I made set in South America? EDIT: I already posted a specific post for the game, but if you are seeing this and want to go directly to the Itch.io page here is the link

 [Americania](https://filbencs.itch.io/americania) 

Thank you guys for the approval!!

I saw that one of the rules involve asking mods before posting anything related to content outside Reddit, so here I am :)

As a brazilian myself, I always thought about how rich our continent's history is and decided to make a political sim set in the 19th century where you command a recently independent country through its first steps.

The game is a free project (with no ads or in game purchases)  If you guys approve it, I will share a link to the itch.io page :D

************Did you ever use Taringa! in the early 2010s? Taringa! was a really popular social social network from Argentina in the early 2010s where people made posts about almost anything (sports, video games, music, baits, etc).

Most of the slangs used in Facebook come from that place (+10 papu/lince/m√°quina, que picard√≠a, etc).


************Bolivians, how are the country doing one year after Evo Morales is gone? 


************Are there famous Latin American celebrities who are of Indigenous origin/appearance? Hello Guys, I am from Philippines and I was always curious if there are Indigenous celebrities who have Indigenous appearance and are from Indigenous tribes. 

So far, the only famous indigenous celebrity I know is Mexican actress, Yalitza Aparicio (protagonist of the film, Roma) who is from Mixtec and Trique tribes. Also, there are the Miss Universe contestants Rosa Montezuma (Panama) and Mayra Dias (Brazil).

I also think Indigenous Latin Americans have similar appearance to Southeast Asians like the "moreno" complexion, almond-shaped eyes and black hair.


************do you guys feel Mexico ignores South America and most of Latin America? Do you guys feels that Mexico does not care about Latin America. That they only care about the north.  They are the second largest economy in Latin America, yet they rarely seem to pay attention to the rest of Latin America.

************Census 2020 Results Hey people,

After a few months of miscommunication, disappearing volunteers, and general apathy, here are the results from the subreddit census taken in late Oct / early Nov 2020! It seems to be an open secret since people have been discussing it a lot the last two days.

My attempts at visualizations (thanks quarantine period #3): [https://imgur.com/a/jwbJysI](https://imgur.com/a/jwbJysI).

Google's automatic visualizations: [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfbQEnewC8nD1lxDsT_NE3GsugTXYlDHbovbYv2Dpd3Nku3Ow/viewanalytics).

There was **endless** data I had to stop at some point. I might do a diplomado in data science this year so if I volunteer / am volunteered to do this again it could be better.  ¬Ø\\\_ („ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø

Cheers.

Edit: I'm not going to say how long I spent on this cuz it's embarrassing, but there are still (at least) two typos. Fuck.

I didn't include the question about how the pandemic affected you because it was out of date. Nor did I include the question about frequency of certain activities (seeing movies, exercising) because feedback said it was confusing.

It may seem weird for u, but I'm very curious about the dynamic of a lot of countries speaking the same language in the same continent.


************Question for Costa Ricans and Uruguayans: Do you often feel that your countries are overromanticized on the internet just like other "perfect" countries like Sweden or Canada? What are some flaws in your societies that people from the outside may not know about? Kind of like how New Zealand, despite having a reputation of being one of the best countries in the world, has a serious problem of male suicides and Maori people living in poverty and being unemployed. Yet, despite these clear flaws in the system, people still romanticize New Zealand anyway. 

What problems exist in your country that may shock people?


************Non-brazilian latinos, how do you feel about brazilian cuisine? 


************Is Brazil really that terrible as people make it out to be? I see a lot of people on the internet, as well as actual brazilians saying that Brazil is hell on earth and you should never go there. Like it can't be that bad right? I'm honduran (born and raised). My country is an actual shithole. I don't think Brazil can't be worse than that lmao. I would really like to visit there someday, seems like a beautiful country with tons of culture and diversity


************Brazilians, why do you laugh with "kkkkk"? 


************Serious question: is this sub turning into a joke? Isn't the purpose of this sub to answer questions about Latin America from people inside and outside our region?  I like a good joke and I try to be funny when appropriate when answering questions, but come on.  Just look at the questions that have been posted today about visiting a country that starts with an "M" or an "V".  Rarely a shitpost is really funny and when it is we should enjoy it; but it seems that they are becoming the norm.


************Spanish speakers, what was the most embarrassing moment you had interacting with another Latin American that was provoked by different meanings for the same word in Spanish? Either online or in real life, anything goes.

************What are some words in your language that were big and with time became small? A long time ago, the portuguese nobility was always addressed as "vossa merc√™" (something like "your grace"). Here in Brazil, land owners would demand from their slaves to be treated the same way and, I guess because african slaves and native people didn't know how to speak Portuguse propely, soon the expression became "vossemerc√™", then "vosmerc√™" and by the XIX century it already was just "voc√™" and a way more colloquial way to address someone here than the commomly used "tu" in Portugal. Currently, "voc√™" is increasingly becoming a weirder word to say, the kind of word that you only see TV anchors pronoucing propely all the time, so me and most people I know most of the time only say "c√™"


************Would you call Chilean Spanish a dialect? Is it an accent or a dialect of Spanish?


************Nayid Bukele has put the words "Dictador de El Salvador" in his twitter bio, what are your opinion on this? 


************My first post: how is your country culturally divided? In Colombia, we have different cultural groups that are mainly divided by accent, but also by agricultural activity, folk costumes, ancestry (European/African/indigenous), music styles and geography, at the end of the day  [these](https://obregon.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/dialectos_espac3b1ol_de_colombia.png) are the divisions of our country.

So Paisas are like very conservative, coffee growers, with mostly European ancestry. We, Rolos are mainly Muisca/Spanish descendants, the region produces potatoes and onions and our habitat is the Cundiboyacense plateau and Coste√±os are more Andalusian/Arabic/African/Zen√∫ influence, but they live in the Caribbean Coast and the Northern Plains and eat much more plantains than potatoes or yucca and listen to Cumbia or Vallenato. What about your countries?   


Sometimes the differences can be so big, that there can be hatred or discrimination on account of region. Does that happen in your country too?

I beg Colombians to complete the list of Colombian regions, so they can also participate.


************Why does the U.S have a very particular cherry-picked version of Latin American culture? I'm an American Brazilian. Born in Brazil, grew up in America.

Im practically more American than I am Brazilian in culture, but recently I started to re-evaluate this. Why? Whenever you go to Latin America, you will notice that people are much less uptight about things. And yet, American culture absorbs Latin American only in a particularly cherry picked way.

In Cuba and DR, you can just a woman  "*Mi amor"* or "*Hola mami, que pasa?".* But if you try doing this in the US, people are offended.

In Latin America, it is very common to do cheek kissing. That doesn't happen in the US. Why?

On average, teenagers in Latin America drink and have sex much earlier than in english speaking cultures. Sex is less taboo.

What else? This culture of lawsuits and wanting to sue everybody. Why?

I feel that despite the United States having a "Latin American community" or "*Latinx*" as they call it, the truth is that the Latin culture is relatively selective in the US. It's not really a Latin American culture but rather an *anglicized version of Latin culture.* In the same way that Taco Bell is not *real* Mexican food.

Like ok, you appreciate Shakira, Pitbull, Taco Bell, and trendy Frida Kahlo imitations. And?

I will admit that cities like Miami, Las Vegas, and Los Angeles have a bit of that Latin energy. Yes.

But overall, I find that the *perspective* of Latin America by Americans is incredibly myopic and cherry-picked. Things our ancestors and current relatives find a bit ridiculous.

Im not discriminating and hating but rather asking **why does this current culture exists?**

Why does America have this particular cherry picked version of Latin American culture?


************am i considered latina? if i was born an raised in south america but my parents are asian can i still consider myself latina? this has always confused me a bit because the term ‚Äúlatino‚Äù is more of an ethnicity which relates to culture rather than race. so much of my identity revolves around my experiences in south america so i would consider myself latina in many forms but then again i obviously don‚Äôt look the part. what do y‚Äôall think?

************Which countries in Latin America have the worst relations? https://m.chuing.net/mai/img_character_main/17/176314682494.jpg

I am from South Korea and I don't often comment on YouTube. because almost 60% of South Koreans and Japanese are always arguing with their poor English there. Lol The remaining 40% of South Koreans and Japanese mock them by saying, 'They quarrel again Haha.' Well, The only Latin American countries I've seen on YouTube with bad relationships are Peru and Chile, though. Is there any toxic rivaly like South Korea/Japan in Latin America?

P. S. Ironically, Football fans in South Korea and Japan respect each other. Because we know that we are the best teams in Asia. Most of our problems are caused by political, diplomatic and territorial disputes, though. For example, the news that became the biggest one in Japan during the last Tokyo Olympics was not which country won the most medals. The fact is that it was South Korea was the only country that refused to eat food made with Japanese ingredients and brought ingredients from their own country. Most Japanese citizens were being butthurt on us about it, though. (South Korean government was very concerned about Japan's radioactive contamination problem.)


************What‚Äôs the deal with Hispanics giving Puerto Ricans and Dominicans hard time for the way they speak Spanish? Are they that difficult to understand. I was at a event here in the USA and i was with my Puerto Rican friend and he was talking to a Venezuelan but from his facial expression he was getting upset. The Venezuelan said he can‚Äôt understand Puerto Ricans and Dominicans because they don‚Äôt speak Spanish properly. My gringo ass had to translate between two Spanish speakers it was unbelievable and embarrassing.


************Do you adress your parents by "usted", "t√∫" or "vos" Here in Chile, it's a mix. I've been with friends
that address their parents using "usted", and it's really weird, at least for me, because I've always addressed mine using "t√∫". 

You CANNOT treat your parents with "vos" (pronounced "voh"). That would be extremely disrespectful, and it could even start a fight.


************for those who are not from Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay: have you tried yerba mate? edit: and Chile

I think those outside of Latin America could also answer. 

Have you tried yerba mate? Was it the traditional way or a toasted herb tea? Liked?

if you have never tried it, are you interested in drinking one day?

************What words and phrases are often used in dubbed series/movies but never in real life? Kids often talk like T.V. (acento discovery kids) and say things like : emparedado, Goma de mascar, Petear traseros, rockanrolear, retrete, malvaviscos. Mando a distancia, ordenador, revanada, etc. 

But besides them nobody uses them. 

Do you know any others?


************How do you call titty fuck in your country? We call it ‚ÄúEspanhola‚Äù in Brazil but I heard they call it either ‚ÄúLa Turca‚Äù or ‚ÄúLa Cubana‚Äù in Spain, some like that lol.

************Do men from Latin American countries like fem boys or is it a Reddit thing? So I'm American with lets say some Mexican ancestry and I visit reddit subs that speak Spanish because memes have actually help me improve my ability to read Spanish. One thing I noticed in these subs they always joke about fem boys and having some fetish towards them, for example I see it more common now in Argentinean reddit subs.

Is this a Reddit thing or something that occurs in Latin America but no one really talks about it?

************What is something that you thought everyone in LatAm did but learned in this sub is unique to your country? In Brazil is pretty common to consider pets part of the family. Spending a lot of money on toys, doggy daycare, petfriendly malls etc, is new but so common there's petshops everywhere. I remember a thread once about pets and other countries users say that spoiling pets is seen as weird where they live and an europe/usa thing. In here it takes walking a dog on a baby stroller for people to call you crazy.

************On Chile, the right wing was unable to obtain 33% of the voting to redact the New Constitution. They can't veto anything alone. Thoughts?

Here's a source on english that covers both topics briefly, there are better sources on spanish but english is required here:

************Why has xenophobia increased in Latin America? There has always been issues with foreigners, but not at the levels seen today. What are the reasons for this situation? The mayor of Bogot√° blames Venezuelans for increasing crime.

A presidential candidate in Peru almost got into a fight with a migrant worker.

And other examples... 

I'm older than most of you and I remember that, even in times of crisis, the migration issue wasn't that big. It was sometimes mentioned, but nothing extreme.

This changed in recent times and the reasons seem to be: economic problems, cultural issues and that the amount of foreigners have been too high.

What do you think?


************Why Latin American houses are colorful ? Is there a story behind these colors ? 


************My (m26) wife (f27) just went to Brazil, is grinding ok? My wife told me that during her 2 week trip to Brazil, she has been dancing with other dudes on nights out and grinding with them, she tells me that is all that happened and I believe her. She is Honduran and I am British and there is often a cultural gap that we need to traverse. She told me that it is normal in Latino culture for this to happen and not to worry about it. It doesn¬¥t sit right with me and I need some advice, especially a Latino perspecitve. In an all Latino marriage would this be acceptable? 


************What do Latin Americans think about videos like these made by YouTubers? 


On one hand, I think these creators expose themselves to dangerous situations but it does help give people more knowledge on areas inaccessible to them. Thought the video wasn‚Äôt too sensational and learned a lot from the guide he met later on. This is coming from a 2nd gen American who lives in the US so my perspective is a bit different.

************Have you read recently that Germany embargoed the sale of brazilian armored vehicles to the Philippines, after Brazil refused to send ammunition to Ukraine? Thoughts? There are some articles in portuguese, but here is the [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/11bl9ri/germany_restricts_the_export_of_brazilian_armored/) to the post in r/worldnews.

The comment section was heavily against Brazil, saying it was deserved. For those curious, the Guaran√≠ is an armored vehicle assembled here with mostly brazilian pieces. However, a few tech parts are from Germany and they can embargo sales if they want.

At the beginning of the year, it was also announced that some Guaranis would be sent to Argentina. Don't know what will happen to that deal.


************How do you say ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt give a f*ck‚Äù in your country? I was talking with my German girlfriend about different words in Latin America and this topic came out. In El Salvador we say ‚Äúme vale verga‚Äù.


************Unpopular opinions are, ironically, very popular on Reddit. So I want to hear your popular opinions: what are your most basic, commonly held opinions? Either related specifically to your country and culture, or in general.


************In Germany, openly supporting Nazism (such as doing the Roman salute and denying the Holocaust) can put you in jail. Do you think that similar laws can be applied to your country? 


************Peruvians, what the fuck is going on? I surprisingly struggled to find something about it in the sub, so I hope I‚Äôm not the 1000th person asking, but who are these guys Keiko and Castillo?  What do you guys think of them? Are they threats to democracy? Do you think democracy will survive in Peru in the near future? And, finally, is it truly common to call your political adversaries a terrorist in Peru?


************What do Colombians think of gringos getting Pablo Escobar tattoos? 


************Do people from Spain not want to acknowledge the validity of Latin American Spanish?  I started Spanish class in Barcelona today and in one of the exercises the workbook said a couple met (concer) at a party and then met up (quedar) for a walk on the beach together. I asked the teacher about other words that are also used for meeting up, such as encontar. She was very dismissive. She took an attitude, like I asked a dumb question, and said, No encontrar means to find. In the moment, I was confused because I know for sure that I have used other words for having a meeting/dating/hang out. So I even said, well maybe not encontrar but what is another word for meeting up? She said its only quedar. Then I said well what about in other countries? And she said No. Its just quedar. While we were talking I put it in the translator and it said encontrarse and then later in our workbook, their own textbook used encontrar to say some people met up. So why all this hostility and gaslighting? I don't get it...

Is this a Spain VS Latin America thing? Or is this just a teacher with some kind of a chip on her shoulder. Confused.

Back at home I found this article which clearly confirms there are several common ways to say this other than quedar [https://www.linguno.com/wordComparison/esp/encontrarse-reunirse-verse-quedar/](https://www.linguno.com/wordComparison/esp/encontrarse-reunirse-verse-quedar/)

Encontrar, Reunir, Verse, and Quedar

PS-- This is why AI is going to take over human jobs..because who wants to deal with all this attitude for no reason!

**UPDATE:** Sheesh kabobs! Didn't fathom this would get this traction. Thank you all for the responses! Many of you helped me see the situation for what it is (bitchy teachers); others helped me understand more cultural nuances; and overall just made me feel supported. So thank you so much!! 

I went back to the Language School today ready to unenroll, but with no refunds I tried class under a different set of teachers and had an amazing day!!! They were both sooo nice and fun and thorough. They gave actual instruction (unlike yesterday's teachers who had us fill in the blank exercises using google translate the entire day) and, incidentally, both were ***not*** from Barcelona.

Finally... the language school's administrative rep (who is Brazilian) profusely apologized to me and said the instruction I got was definitely wrong, and admitted to being aware of how crappy my original teachers. She said Labor laws make it really hard to get rid of bad employees. She also confirmed what many of you said.. that Catalonians are known for being mean. She said she has lived here for 7 years and never had 1 Catalonian friend/date nothing. And she offered me a week of free classes


************Are indigenous people viewed as attractive in your country? One night while I (25M) was in Mexico City I was chatting up my local friends who are affluent Mexicans. We came across the topic of dating preferences & I stated that I highly prefer indigenous-looking women like Yalitza Aparcio (Mexican actress).

They laughed and thought I was joking at first & they all agreed that they preferred white girls. 

Nothing wrong with white girls, they are beautiful too. But I was shocked to learn that most Mexican dudes prefer European looking women rather than indigenous. To be fair, most of them were white Mexicans but there were a couple who were even darker than me (I‚Äôm Afro-Venezuelan American) who still preferred white girls.

I‚Äôve been to Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador & Guatemala and didn‚Äôt notice this same sentiment. How are indigenous people perceived in your country in terms of dating preferences?


************Do you feel any cultural connection with Latin Americans in the United States? I'm from Mexico but I find it very hard to find any kind of cultural connection with Mexican - Americans. Even worse if they are very influenced by American politics as they'll see the world in the same way their other countrymen do do. Specially on the topics of ''race'' and colonialism.

For example, neighborhoods in Mexico are called ''colonias'' and nobody in Mexico makes a big deal about it. But when Mexican - Americans find out that neighborhoods are called ''colonias'' they start to ask, ''Why are they called that? That's racist! Colonialism was wrong! It's white supremacy!''. And when you try to explain to them that nobody in Mexico cares that neighborhoods are called colonials, Mexican - Americans then start to say stuff like ''Well how would you feel if a neighborhood was named after Nazis? or Hitler?''.

I live right next to the US border and because of work and family I have dealt with Mexicans - Americans my whole life. I have felt more in common with someone from Yucatan or Oaxaca  than someone from El Centro, California.


************2023 Subreddit Census Edit: **form is closed, results should follow in about 10 days**

It's been a year since the last sub census. So go ahead and take [this year's census](https://forms.gle/mrJSshVNumWEnY5N9) if you wish. No identifying data will be visible to the census owners (i.e., me).

I didn't get many specific suggestions, so the census is quite similar to [last year's](https://www.reddit.com/r/asklatinamerica/comments/t9s0cu/2022_subreddit_census_results/).

Have fun, I guess.

************Growing up, when did you learn that your country was, in fact, was a third world country? I remember my brother got mugged in from of my house, we went to the closest police station (cuartel) and the police dude at the front just told us:

"Bueeeeno manito, y como vamos a saber qui√©n te rob√≥ ese tel√©fono si ni siquiera te acuerda como era el, mira a ver publicalo en feisbu"

Then we were like üòê


************Colombian Girlfriend calls me "gordito" ? We have been dating 4 months, i notice she always calls me "gordito" when we greet each other or sometimes when we cuddle. I understand it is endearing for chubby people (usually). The thing is that i work out 5 times a week and althouh i have a small belly i am generally seen as muscular to the general population and not skinny fat/chubby. I used to bodybuild and used to bulk and cut down to 6 pack frequently within months.

I know its not an insult, but is she teasing me and poking fun because of my body type? Or is there another term for "gordito" for significant others?


************Panama has just legalized Cannabis, how long do you think it will be until your nation does so as well? (Or if you think they'll ever do it at all) As of the time of this post Presiden Nito Cortizo signed the paper about an hour ago, legalizing Cannabis in Panama for medical uses.

I know Cannabis is legal in lots of Latam and the Caribbean, but I know it's also not in a lot of other parts (and extremely vilified).

Panama has been part of the front lines in the war on drugs and the more violent and evil parts of it. Legalizing drugs has always been a touchy subject here because of that since we have in many ways bore much of the brunt of the "trafficking" part of the process....To the point we basically had to turn our police into a small "not an army but sure looks like one" and hire contractors from abroad to do nothing but scour for smugglers and violent criminals coming in from abroad and within. For a lot of nations south of Panama I know that the "production" side of the process has taken it's toll and heavily affects the discussion on legalizing drugs.

So yeah, your thoughts on how or when the slow and steady progression of cannabis acceptance in the world is going to impact your nation? If it ever does?


************If Carlos Slim is the richest man in the Mexico, is Carlos Fat the poorest man on the Mexico? And would Carlos Fat be slim because Carlos slim is fat?


************What are some major tourist traps in your country/region and what precautions can you take to avoid them? Hi. So tourist traps are pretty much universal, even in countries that get very few tourists (at least in my experiences and from what I've heard) there are tourist traps. I'm not asking this because I think only Latin America has tourist traps or that there are only tourist traps.

What are some of the biggest tourist traps in your country? How do they work and where are they located? I hope I don't sound ignorant, if I do, please tell me and I will edit it. Anyway, thanks and enjoy the rest of your day.


************What is your favorite junk food snack from your country? Growing up in the US my favorite was Doritos. Every now and then I will eat [Ping√ºinos](https://jumbocolombiafood.vteximg.com.br/arquivos/ids/3478664-750-750/7705326053206.jpg?v=637158272448200000) in Colombia as a special treat. What‚Äôs your go-to?


************why are some African Americans so focused on race in latam? Some Africans American are so fixated on trying to prove that discrimination against dark skinned latinos is as bad as it is in the United states. I simply do not get it. Some will make long arguments about it. Like we don't see race in at least my country, dominican Republic. We do not treat people differently because of their skin color. 

All we see is our nationality, all the people in my country have the same customs and culture. Unlike the USA, where white and black people have different cultures and ways of living. 

It quite exhausting to have foreigners point out over and over issues that may not be there. I truly believe we have more severe problems in at least my country than to try to find "la Quinta Pata al gato"


************What's a topic that a foreigner that comes to visit your country should not talk about with locals? 


************What is the worst insult they can say to you in Latin America or Europe? 


************Chileans, I didn't know you guys had elections today. What do you think of the potential winners: Sichel and Boric? 


************Evo Morales claimed to advocate for indigenous rights primarily throughout his terms as Bolivia's first and only indigenous president. From an indigenous standpoint, what did he actually accomplish in advancing indigenous rights? I've recently been researching Bolivian politics from across the past two decades and I'm a bit confused by the polarizing reports on Evo's presidency. From claims that his reign was an authoritarian narco-state to others claiming he was a beloved leader who brought forward the biggest advancements in Bolivia's history. I understand there can be truth to each of those claims, but I'm interested more in what he actually accomplished for the people he swore to serve. Specifically the indigenous population. So, what did he accomplish for indigenous rights through his time as president?


************I've noticed A LOT more hatred against modern europe because of "colonization" (lets say spaniards and portuguese) from american (USA) latinos than from any actual latinamerican. What do you think are the reasons for this? First, i don't care. It doesn't really affect me, but i'm curious because i don't get it. 

I'm talking about literal hate: "racism", name-calling, calls for extinction (i swear) and just your usual 14 year old ideology.

Is this just ignorance? Weird american identity politics? Weird american revisionism?


************Am I the only one who doesn't agree with the saying "Portuguese is easy to learn for Spanish speakers"? I have seen that phrase repeated constantly in this subreddit.

I don't agree.

Portuguese is not Russian, Mandarin, Arabic or French. Those languages are practically impossible to learn. But Portuguese is **not** easy. Portuguese has a very complicated grammar and a very difficult phonology. Portuguese has tenses that almost no other language has (*futuro do subjuntivo* and *infinitivo pessoa*l). We also need to consider the vast diversity of accents (inside one country) and that the differences in grammar and vocabulary between different dialects of Portuguese is huge.

Now, it does help to be a native Spanish speaker, but that doesn't make it "easy".


************What's something about Anglo countries that your find plain weird? *you


************You guys eat rice and beans every day? Here in Brasil, yes


************Do people in your country call your president by nicknames or this is just Brazilian thing? Here in Brazil, people often call Bolsonaro as Bozo, Bonoro, Biroliro, Bostonaro, Bolsocaro, Bolsoasno, Capet√£o and several other names.

Supporters often use Mito or Bolsomito. But the nicknames are mostly offensive.


************Have you met a Mexican person in your life before? What was your perception at first?


************Hispanics, do you say "Yo que se" or "Que se yo"? It's for a poll, thanks üôÇ


************What was Venezuela like before Chavez? Was it like Brazil? Or the USA? Or did it have its own distinct vibe?


************Hispanohablantes and Portuguese-speaking friends: what words or expressions make the other language "confusing" for you? For me (Brazilian speaker of Portuguese), those both words are very confusing in Spanish: "nadie" and "empezar". The first one means "nobody", but it is very confusing, because it sounds like "nada" (nothing), nobody in portuguese is "ningu√©m", which is very different. I can't help listening "nadie" and understanding "nada" (nothing). 

"Empezar" is confusing because there isn't a similar word like that in Portuguese. We simply use "come√ßar", which means "to being, to start something". 

Around 90% of Spanish words sounds something familiar or understandable for us (as we know, both languages are highly mutually inteligeable), but empezar pretty much sounds like nothing, and it is a word so commonly used, it took me around 3 days in Argentina to understand that "empezar" is "come√ßar" lol (yeah, I didn't study it a lot, so my fault too).


************What do you guys think about this thread talking about ethnicity in Argentina regarding the world cup? https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackPeopleTwitter/comments/zpqkhs/just_different_flavors_of_colonialism/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button

I don't know if it's a thing with americans or what... but the takes on race (not only in Argentina but in all of latin america) are... weird to say the least.


************How Latin America voted in the UN resolution to suspend Russia from the UN Human Rights Council In favor:  Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Guatemala, Haiti, Peru.

Against:  Bolivia, Cuba, Nicaragua.

Abstained from voting:  Beliz, Brazil, El Salvador, Mexico

Venezuela did not vote. 

No surprises with the "No" votes.  But why do you think those four countries abstained from voting?


************Which is a subreddit that it's supposed to be made for you, but you don't like? (And why?) Which is a subreddit that it's supposed to be made for your country, religion, sexuality, disability or fandom, but you don't relate at all or simply don't like?

In my case, I'm an Argentinean atheist diagnosed with Asperger, but I don't like r/Atheism, r/aspergers or the main Argentinean subs

r/aspergers is the least bad of all my choices, since it isn't a complete cesspit and it can be actually wholesome and relatable sometimes, but the last time I visited, the posts where pure garbage. The sub was full of gatekeeping, transphobia (people that literally said "I'm unable to comprehend gender, so why should I respect pronouns?), hate to "less functional" autistic people, a depressive amount of self hate, and, surprisingly, a huge number of posts from neurotypicals complaining about autistic people being insufferable and ridiculous. (Edit: I'll try to give it a second chance today)

Most of the Argentinean subreddits are only about political drama, and lame shitpost. One of the exceptions is r/DankArgentina, but sadly, that sub is dead, and all the posts are locked for a unknown reason.

Lastly, r/Atheism is an awful subreddit, full of edgy 14 years old  who think they're smart solely because they hate Christians and Muslims (I was one of them, sadly). The fact that most of the posts are US related  makes it even more difficult to be relatable.

************A message of union After seeing some really horrible responses (by both Panamanians and Colombians) to [this question](https://www.reddit.com/r/asklatinamerica/comments/jtq9b0/colombians_how_do_you_feel_about_the_separation/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) made with clear biased intentions, I can only say this:

Latin America is living already very difficult moments. We are back to the 1980s with falling economies, political instability and social unrest.

Do we really need to fight with each other?

I am not saying we not fighting is going to solve our problems, but it sure won't make them worse.

As you guys know, I never run away from controversial issues. I am not only controversial, but controversy itself. However, there are ways to ask questions.

In this case, this question has been asked before. The general consensus is that we have bigger problems now than thinking about the past.

I am sorry for the stupid things some Panamanian user said about guerrillas and I hope Colombians don't think of us as a "West Barranquilla" and "coste√±os in another country". I've been twice to Colombia and I loved it.

************The Dutch accent in Suriname compared with other Dutch speaking countries. These are the "standard" accents of Dutch spoken in the Dutch speaking countries. There are more regional and cultural accents in all three countries, but these are the "standard" ones you'll hear in each one. The video's are a few commercials from the countries.

************After Canada, Venezuela has the largest amount of Chinese make up in their population in the Western Hemisphere (1.5%). How come I have never seen one? I have seen Chinese Argentines and Chinese Peruvians before and of course Chinese Mexicans but I have never seen Chinese Venezuelans


************If a native can‚Äôt roll their R‚Äôs is that the English equivalent of a speech impediment? 


************I want to move to Latin America, how easy will it be to start a new life there? (After Covid19!) I've recently been thinking of moving from my home in the UK to a Spanish speaking part of Latin America. I'm thinking Colombia or Chile, but maybe Peru or Ecuador. Basically I just want to get as far from home as I can, I don't have a preferred country to move to. I love my home country but I'm scared of getting stuck in my home town and never growing. Plus I have some toxic memories from Britain I want to leave behind me. 

Will it be easy to arrive and find a basic job in the first month or so? Currently my Spanish is pretty limited but I'm working on it! I'm 21 with not much work experience and no qualifications other than high school, so my options are probably teaching English, something simple like washing dishes or something in the health and fitness industry (I've been a professional athlete for a few years so I feel I have some experience to offer there)

Another option would be to do some volunteering work to get a feel for it first, but everything I've seen looks really expensive. 

I speak English (native), French (C1) and Spanish (B1) so the language shouldn't be a massive issue after a bit of work. 

The reason I want to come to Latin America is that know very little about it. I've spent the last few years travelling around Europe and want to go somewhere totally new.  

TL:DR - 
1 - How easy is it to find work in Latin America as a foreigner with no experience or contacts
2 - Which country should I move to?

Thank you in advance!

************Are you/your circle of friends having kids? I'm almost 30 and none of my circle of friends has any kids. Not even getting married is a topic of discussion. Some of them are in relationships but all of them are into their careers.

Personally, I think I wont have any kids, Im gay as well. It's weird to think people at my age used to have kids, own a house, car and stuff like that.

What about you?


************Have you heard anything about the lgbt protests in DR? So, about a week or so ago a modification to the proposed new penal code of DR removed "sexual orientation" (and according to some sources gender/gender identity as well) from the list of attributes for which someone can legally argue they were discriminated. As a response lgbt activists have been protesting in front of congress and yesterday a march was organized because of it as well, it got sizeable participation from young people.

Now, this comes at a time when a lot of things are happening regionally as well, Haiti's president was killed last week and now Cuba has big protests against their government, which in itself is notable. However, the coverage locally has been a bit limited, with most reporting only being about the first day and the march of yesterday being relegated to smaller articles with the situation in Cuba and Haiti taking the front page on all local newspapers.

This makes me assume that the coverage internationally must be nonexistent, but just to confirm I guess it doesn't hurt to ask and maybe inform a bit. Had you heard anything about this situation at all? What do you think about it so far?

(I suggest looking deeper into it as well, this is just a small summary from my point of view after all)

************Venezuelans, what are your thoughts of your election today? I heard that some parties can't participate, other parties boycotted the elections, and some analysts says the abstention rate is at 70% ([Folha de S√£o Paulo](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/11/em-sao-paulo-abstencao-cresce-e-chega-a-29-no-primeiro-turno.shtml), in portuguese.

So, venezuelans of the sub, what are your thoughts on your election today?


************What do you think about Biden's plan for Central America? Context: [https://joebiden.com/centralamerica/](https://joebiden.com/centralamerica/)

Question is specially for those in Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, but I'd like to know everyone's thoughts. 

Personally I'm pretty scared. Call me paranoid, but everytime the United States had to do with the Northern Triangle's politics, things had ended in coups, civil wars and misery. (Latest coup being as recent as 2009 in Honduras!) 

It's even worse when you think that Guatemala and El Salvador are very scarred due to little progress since the end of their civil wars, and Guatemala/El Salvador/Honduras are also very crippled due to gang activity.


************A recent thread asked how common bilingualism in your countries, and the vast consensus is that it‚Äôs rare. Given this, where did you learn high-level English? It seems the majority of English-speaking Latin Americans are out of the ordinary within the context of your countries.  What circumstances allowed you to learn English to a high level? Or was it just personal motivation?  Are you similar to your peers in your language ability, or do you stand out?  Does your family know English or other languages?

Thank you
‚Äîa bilingual American on the way to being trilingual with Spanish.


************Despite all south american countries (and Mexico) having warm and friendly culture, which one has the "coldest" people? By that I mean all of latin america is friendly but if you'd have to pick one country where the people are  the least friendly (or just more reserved than the rest) which one would it be?

&#x200B;

For example I'd say my country (Hungary) is fairly reserved compared to our neighbours. But compared to Idk Sweden or the Dutch and the Danes we are much more friendlier.


************CONFIRMED. I understand portu√±ol. Context: I work at a call center for gringos and just about now I received a call from a person who didn't speak english just portuguese (he was from brazil, we often receive non english speakers but they speak spanish).since we don't have a lot of callers from brazil or portugal the company I work for does not have a dedicated department for portuguese's speakers so I told him that I spoke spanish and aside from some clarification needed from both sides, I was able to understand him and help him with his issue.

 Hahahah I felt kind of funny so I thought I might as well share it here.


************What misconceptions people in Latin America have about other places? 


************Do you have vainillas in your country? How do you call them? Vainillas in Argentina are [these](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/3c/99/1b/3c991b602714b85ac6d5b37f8e635062.jpg) things. Eating a nice vainilla with my coffee i started wondering if other countries have it and call it the same.


************Which country in Latin America is culturally closest to yours? 


************Did any Brazilian television program (like "novelas") ever be broadcast in your country? I know that Globo network arrives to broadcast in Portuguese-speaking countries (Portugal, Mo√ßambique, Angola), but I have no idea of its influence in the Hispanic sphere.


************Latin America is the most urbanized region in the world with almost 80% of its citizens living in cities. Why do you think most people in North America and Europe don‚Äôt associate Latin American countries with cities and urban living? 


************What's a first world problem that gets talked about by americans/europeans in onlie discussions that you can't relate to? For example, in gaming topics you have people saying:

\-"I own so many games but I don't know what to play"

\-"steam sales suck now that I bought everything I wanted to play"

\-"ahh I remember when I was a kid I booted up my xbox 360 and played halo 3/modern warfare 2" (I think this is just me being jealous lol)


************Latin America is the most urbanized region in the world. Why do you think people on Reddit act as if it isn‚Äôt so? 


************In recent news in Cologne, Germany a Jewish man was beaten for wearing a kippah in public. In contrast, how is anti-semitism in your country? Are jews welcomed? Are there hate crimes against them? Who perpetuates the hate crimes? 


************Can we talk about what's happening in El Salvador? The new congress will remove the judges from the Supreme Court because last year they declared some restrictions due to COVID-19 unconstitutional? https://www.dw.com/es/oficialismo-en-el-salvador-pide-destituir-jueces-constitucionales-del-supremo/a-57400940

Some people are worried this could end up with Bukele having total control of the country.

I have never been a fan of Bukele, but I admit he has been effective in reducing crime. However, this is not a good sign.


************Do you like pineapple on pizza? I'm serious.
If you english men want to crusify me, then come to Colombia and you will see that in every pizza restaurant there is, there is "hawaiiana" pizza, which, guess what, has pineapple, which we all love in pizza.
There's also the "Tropical" with pineapple as well, but not as good as the "hawaiiana".

Is it the same in other countries of Latin America?


************Do you guys call women "minas" in your country? Or is it just an Argentina thing?

I'm not 100% sure, but in Brazil, it's very common for man to call a woman "mina", at least in S√£o Paulo state. I know that's what Argentines say too, but is it also common to say that in your country?

"E ai cara, t√° saindo com aquela mina da universidade?"


************According to official data, Argentines own more US dollars per capita than Americans, and Argentina's savers represent 20% of total dollars outside the US. Should Argentina dollarize? Argentine savers have some USD 200,000 million in dollar bills, which means that the country owns 10% of the value of the North American currency bills that circulate around the world . The weight of currency in the economy is so significant that in Argentina there are more dollars per capita than in the issuing country itself, the United States.

This was estimated by the economist Nicol√°s Gadano , based on figures provided by the president of the Central Bank, Miguel √Ångel Pesce, in a presentation before the Argentine Federation of Professional Councils of Economic Sciences. According to Gadano, the USD 200,000 million held by savers represents 20% of the total dollars that are outside the country of origin of that currency.

This calculation arises when considering information on the balance of payments published quarterly by INDEC and official data from the Government of the United States, which in a 2020 update estimated that there are some 2 trillion (million million) dollars in circulation. This means that one of every ten dollars that exist in the world is in the hands of savers in Argentina .

************How people survive on average salary in Uruguay? Hola. I‚Äôm newcomer to Uruguay and one thing seems shocking to me. Many products are way more expensive than in Europe, rents are somewhat cheaper - for unfurnished places (and furniture is way more expensive again)‚Ä¶ and Numbeo says the average salary is about 800USD net/month. Is this number wrong? Or how can people survive and function on this salary?

I don‚Äôt mean this in insulting or offensive way. Uruguayans are very nice and to they appear to be more in tune with life and reality than ‚Äúus‚Äù Europeans dragged in consumerism etc. That‚Äôs also reason why I came here. But I think on 800/month I would struggle to eat 3meals a day here.


************Saw a thread about how to not be an annoying type of gringo. What can I do to be an annoying gringo? (Sorry  [u/crippling\_altacct](https://www.reddit.com/user/crippling_altacct/), I felt cheeky)


************Opinions on Article 14.3 of the new Chilean Constitution? *Chile declara a Am√©rica Latina y el Caribe como zona prioritaria en sus 
relaciones internacionales. Se compromete con el mantenimiento de la 
regi√≥n como una zona de paz y libre de violencia; impulsa la integraci√≥n 
regional, pol√≠tica, social, cultural, econ√≥mica y productiva entre los Estados, y 
facilita el contacto y la cooperaci√≥n transfronteriza entre pueblos ind√≠genas.*

ENG:

*Chile declares Latin America and the Caribbean as a priority area in its international relations. It is committed to maintaining the region as a zone of peace  and free from violence; promotes regional, political, social, cultural, economic and productive integration among the States, and 
facilitates contact and cross-border cooperation among indigenous peoples.*


************What is the most uncomfortable, unwelcoming place you have ever been to? This is taken from a thread I read over at Ask A German today.  Berlin and small town pubs were some popular answers in that one.

Could be anything...a country, a city, somebody's residence, a region, a business, whatever.


************Cubans LIVING in Cuba. What do you think of Che Guevara? So I am a socialist (not here to argue about that) however I have a very bad view on Che Guevara and Fidel Castro (for many reasons, especially homophobia) and I recently got into an argument with that with other socialists here in Reddit.

I mentioned how widely known his homophobia is for many and they said it was a propaganda thing of the Cubans living in the US (which I know they hate the whole revolution thing almost unanimously) and I wanted to know the opinion of mainland Cubans.


************Going off accents, which countries in Latin America are the toughest for you to tell apart? Canadians who travel abroad are invariably mistaken for Americans because the linguistic differences between Canadian and American English are so subtle. Having visited Canada and worked with Canadians, I can usually pick them out especially if they're from the eastern side of the country.

Which countries are the toughest for you to tell apart?


************Do you use the word "gringo" to refer to anyone who isn't from your country, foreigners except other latin americans, or just people from Europe and the Anglosphere? 


************Canadians are Canucks, Americans are Yanks, Australians are Aussies, New Zealanders are Kiwis, British are A-holes, and people from your country are? I believe you could call Parceros to Colombians, Boricuas to Puerto Ricans, Ticos to Costa Ricans, Venezuelans are Chamos, and could I refer to Brazilians as Zilians?


************Do you consider that India in terms of quality of life is worse than Latin America? I have seen many videos of India, and the truth is it is disgusting to see so much dirt, lack of hygiene and poverty in the streets, but I have asked myself, Do you believe that their standard of living is worse than that of Latin America?


************The best country to immigrate to in latin America? (As a gay person) I'm (24 yo M) from an islamic/arabic country. I have a master's degree in social sciences and yeah..I'm GAY.

It's impossible for me to live here. Immigration isn't really a choice, It's a must, I'll never be myself in here.

I think Latin America would be a good choice for me, since it's affordable and Spanish is a language that I love. 

What would be the best country to immigrate to? And what's the easiest way for doing so?


************What Latin American country doesn't exist (but probably should/could)? The [Rep√∫blica de Entre R√≠os](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rep%C3%BAblica_de_Entre_R%C3%ADos?wprov=sfla1) could have probably turned into an independent nation. 

What are other cases of short-lived independent nations, secession claims or attempts, claimed territories, and the like do you know of?


************Are telenovelas dead? (maybe except in Brazil) Back in the 1980s and 1990s telenovelas used to be big. A premiere or finale could paralyze a country. However, since the late 2000s it seems telenovelas are mostly irrelevant and even their target audience has decided to stop watching. Even my mom prefers to watch Law & Order SVU, Chicago PD or Chicago Fire than a telenovela.

I think only in Brazil telenovelas are still relevant, but they have indeed lost a lot of popularity.

Some reasons why this happened?

**FIRST**: Time. Some telenovelas were so long and a few of them lasted even 2 years. In today's world, nobody wants to spend so much time in a TV show.

**SECOND**: Lack of diversity. For better or worse, today people care a lot about representation. So, telenovelas being so white and with a bad representation of minorities is not a good way to sell it to the young crowd. This has changed somewhat in recent years, but it's too late.

**THIRD**: Competition. You have so many new platforms such as Netflix, HULU or Amazon Video that didn't exist in the past. These platform offer a lot of new and interesting products for all audiences.

**FOURTH**: Bad Acting. Telenovelas were never realistic, but actors used to be better. After 2000, looks started to matter more than good acting. People tolerated this at the beginning, but it seems at some point they couldn't resist anymore.

**FIFTH**: Content. Telenovelas stopped innovating and in Mexico - for example - they didn't stop making remakes of old telenovelas. With the competition of new platforms, people just stopped watching and discovered newer and better content.


************Does your country have a fascist party still active? I read that some countries still have their fascist parties going on... Here in Brazil we had the A√ß√£o Integralista wich is "kinda" active but it is ilegal. Does your country still have a fascist party? Legal or Ilegal? *This is for educacional purposes*


************Is it offensive in your country to refer to a person as "negro, negra"? Is it an uncomfortable/awkward word to use? In some latinoamerican countries calling a person "negro"  is a tricky thing  while in others is used to show affection.

How is it in yours?


************What is something you hate from being Latin American? It could be the stereotype, the economics, politics, and etc. I live in Venezuela so mine is basically everything


************How are you treated abroad vs in your home country?  So, I'm a Mexican girl with white skin & dirty blonde hair, studying in Europe. Before coming here, I never really thought much about my appearance. In Mexico, no one questions where I‚Äôm from. But in Europe people are surprised to find out I'm Mexican, but say they had a hunch because of my "exotic features". In the US & some parts of Canada people refuse to believe I'm Mexican (even Mexican Americans do this). Once I show gringos my Mexican ID card all of a sudden i''m not "white" anymore & they ask me if I have any indigenous blood & if so, from which indigenous tribe. In other Central American countries people assume I'm rich & an easy target for scams/tourist traps (I'm middle class). In the DR people were shocked Spanish is my native language. In Argentina & Chile I blend in until they hear me speak. In China surprisingly some people thought I'm Uyghur (My Mandarin is pretty good). 


************Do you consider Chile and/or Uruguay to be first world? Both have a strong economies, both have high human development, and both have a strong education system in the region. What do you think? Or do you think they are fools gold and things are much better on paper than in real life?

EDIT: Thanks for your answers. I am from Mexico  but I‚Äôve always found these countries to be interesting an developed (at first glance). I hope one day all of Latin America gets to be developed with great qualities of life for its people, but sadly it looks like that won‚Äôt come close to happening in our lifetimes.


************Do you think the number 24 is ‚Äògay‚Äô? Just read an article about why no one on Brazil wore the 24 jersey during the Copa and wanted to see how widespread the belief was that 24 was a ‚Äògay‚Äô number. Can anyone explain why that‚Äôs the case? 

Does this extend to preferring Kobe‚Äôs early years 8 jersey over his late career 24 one? Just really confused by this whole thing. Please help.


************A referendum on the status of Puerto Rico will be held on November 3rd. What are y'alls thoughts, both Puerto Ricans and everybody else? https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Puerto_Rican_status_referendum

"¬øDebe Puerto Rico ser admitido inmediatamente dentro de la Uni√≥n como un Estado?" Si No

************what's this sub's opinion on donald trump winning the elections?  im really sad and scared because brazilian politics tends to be a reflection of the american one. everything that happens there happens here later too, and this far-right extremism will come back to our society now that trump will go full power. also, now, it's guaranteed that we'll have some far-right politician in 2026 running to be president or even bolsonaro again, since they're trying everything to make him eligible again.


************Whats up with Chileans beefing with Venezuelans all over Twitter? I know this subreddit doesn‚Äôt let attach any media but I‚Äôve seen Chileans talk mad shit about Venezuelans and how Chileans have the best economy in all of LATAM and they‚Äôre superior to everyone. Some countries are being paired with them too, like Peru.


************Why is Spanish unpopular in Brazil despite being surrounded by Hispanophone countries? I fail to understand how the USA, despite being notoriously known for being monolingual, has more Spanish speakers than Brazil. (42 million compared to 460,018!) This is even though the USA shares only one border with a Hispanophone country while Brazil is surrounded by most of them.

Why is this? Is it due to a lack of Hispanophone migrations, unlike the USA?


************Netflix is making an adaptation of One Hundred Years of Solitude, any thoughts, wishes, expectations? Here's the link if you want to watch the teaser: https://youtu.be/p2_QybaXvJo 

I'm unsure whether it's going to be a movie or a series, it really just shows them building a miniature filming set

edit: forgot to mention it's going to be in Spanish apparently!


************What do you think of Mexico refusing entry to a lot of Colombians? Recently, a lot of Colombians have been refused entry to Mexico, and many say they've been treated rather badly by the immigration officials before being deported. It's been a big news story in Colombia, but has anything similar happened with those of other nationalities?


************We Colombians call our president "Porky", "Malvado doctor tocino" and other pig related names. What pejorative terms do you sue for your president? 


************Guatemala approved a law that forbids same-sex marriage constitutionally and strongly criminalized abortion (up to 25 years in prison, doesn't matter if was a miscarriage or not). What do you think about this? 


************People dating or those who dated someone from a different Latin American country other than yours, what cultural challenges did you find in your relationship? Share with us if there were any kind of troublesome practices you found confusing or misleading. I'd like to know if all Latin Americans share the same cultural view regardless of their nationality or if it differs from country to country in terms of dating abroad.


************If you had to live in Africa, which country would you choose? I think I would choose Cape Verde.

They are among the best African countries in every indicator possible (never THE BEST, but always in the top 10). For example: [10th best HDI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_African_countries_by_Human_Development_Index), [7th best GDP (PPP) per capita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_African_countries_by_GDP_(PPP)_per_capita), [3rd less corrupt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption_Perceptions_Index) (in the general ranking, they're **53 positions ahead of Brazil**), [5th most economically free](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_of_Economic_Freedom#2020_Index_in_full) (again, in the general ranking, they're **68 positions ahead of Brazil**).

There's no language barrier.

The country is beautiful

************If we all laugh at Argentinians who think they're Europeans because of their parents/grandparents. Why do people don't do the same with people from the US who think they're latinos for the same reasons?

Being descendant of Europeans does not make you European and being descendant of latinos does not make you latino.


************What was the most "this person has absolutely no idea how most people live" interaction you had with someone from the upper classes in your country? 


************"I'm [insert Latin heritage here], but I don't speak Spanish." 

(Preface: Kind of a long read...)

I've always wondered about this topic in Spanish-speaking Latin American circles (I know Brazil is also in Latin America, but please see my comments to other posters about Brazil) outside of the US. From what I've seen, a big part of what is considered "authentic" (please excuse the vulgarity of that term) Latino identity is the ability to speak Spanish. This seems to be especially true outside of the US, where our tunnel vision and toxic racial politics often muddy our understanding of race, ethnicity, and culture as they are perceived outside of our country. 

Anecdotally speaking it seems to me that a person of, say, Puerto Rican descent who speaks no Spanish can say "I'm Puerto Rican" in the US and not be questioned about this statement (generally speaking), whereas if that person were to go to Puerto Rico and make that statement and not speak Spanish, they'd have a more difficult time. 

I've always gotten the impression that Latino identity is more about culture than race, and language is a major aspect of a culture (if not the biggest one) because it is the basis of communication. There are of course other methods of communication like signs and symbols, body language, etc., but verbal and written language are chief among these methods. Thus a person who cannot make use of this kind of communication is almost always at a disadvantage and unlikely to ever be part of the group in the same way as those who speak the language.

My question, then, is this: to what degree do you believe that knowledge of Spanish is necessary to being Latino, and more specifically, to claim to be of a specific Latino culture (i.e., Guatemalan, Cuban, Chilean, etc.)? And an interesting side question: would you ever consider a non-Latino person who speaks fluent Spanish and embraces and lives Latino culture to be Latino?


************If all South American countries united were to invade Brazil, and no outsiders can participate, who would win a war between Brazil vs South America? Also, please take it easy. This is just a silly and dumb question that servers no utility for us, but I think certain cenarios are fun to imagine and sometimes it gives us knowledge. In this case, is BR strong enough or the military power from other countries can actually take BR down? I legit have no clue how strong Chile, Argentina and Colombia can be, for instance. I think in Venezuela's case they are good enough and even a bit technological despite economic problems?

Edit: Yea, France is not included aswell :P.

************Brazil... uhm, whats happening? **Update**: [Apparently](https://www.critica.com.pa/mundo/el-golpe-de-estado-en-brasil-que-resulto-ser-fake-news-575934), although coming from personally little known/reputable sources as well as the rest, theres a high possibility and said new source confirming to an extent than this was indeed fake news. The information could change at any moment, but as for know, we assume it is.

Nonetheless, based on the rest of the news and your own comments, we know the situations is a bit unstable and even if this turns out to be fake, it could happen any day one way or another. So with that said, I wish you guys luck and hope that if any of the "sides" ends up crossing the line, its in an orderly fashioned way, with diplomacy. I will make my best to keep looking for more news in the next few days just in case; Thanks to the ones that commented on this post!

************What's something about Latin America that makes you cringe? 


************Is racism against Asians severe in Latin America? I just read a blog post written by a Korean man who lived in Colombia as a teacher, and while he was mostly positive about his experiences there, he did devote a huge chunk of paragraph talking about the racist gestures and languages he experienced quite frequently. 

I'm currently really into learning Spanish and am using this app called HelloTalk, using which I talk with people from Latin American in Spanish, and so far I've talked to like 50 people and have never had an incident of anybody saying things like "Ching chong," so I'm even wondering if what that dude wrote in his post is what really happened or it's just that he enjoys playing victim.

I have seen on the news some Colombian soccer players saying racial slurs in the middle of Seoul, but I didn't go as far as to generalize the whole population as racist, just them. But that blogger was going as far as to claim racism's pretty bad in Latin America in general, not only in Colombia, where he's living now.  
Is it that the racist sentiment against Asians has been escalated ever since the Covid crisis?


************Why are people on the internet or media, especially men, so fixated with Brazilian, Colombian and Venezuelan women? Women of these nationalities: Have you ever been sexualized based on your nationality? I was watching the show 90 Day Fiance and have noticed that a huge chunk of the women are either Brazilian or Colombian. Ive also noticed that most girlfriend tags involving Latin Americans +gringos or Eurpeans, its almost always one the 3 aforementioned nationalities...Even when I was in DR I heard Dominican dudes talk about their Venezuelan girlfriend /wives like they won the lottery. Where does this sudden obsession come from?


************Do you guys think that portuguese sounds like russian? i saw some people say that but i think they're talking about the european portuguese i'm not sure.

************why is Chile more developed than Argentina? 


************Godwin's Law is the idea that the longer an online discussion continues, the mention of Hitler or Nazis will occur. If there were an internet ‚Äúlaw‚Äù similar to this one about your country, what would it be? What topic would become almost certain to be invoked after the mention of your country? For example, if there were Mexico's Law, it'd be that the longer a discussion around Mexico occurs, the more likely it is that someone brings up cartels. Sometimes I'll see posts about some innocuous Mexican thing, and cartels will be brought up almost immediately.


************is there a coming back to life to Argentina after this defeat? I'm getting Russia 2018 vibes 


************Question to Brazilians: How influential is Brazil in the Lusosphere? What do other lusophones typically think of Brazilians? 


************Wagner Moura was a Brazilian that spoke no Spanish at all and portrayed "Pablo Escobar" in "Narcos". How good was his Spanish in Narcos? In the show "Narcos" about Pablo Escobar, they got a Brazilian named "Wagner Moura" to portray Pablo in this series. He spoke Portuguese and didn't speak a word of Spanish before filming this series. He had to take Spanish classes to portray the character and the whole show was in Spanish. 

My questions are:  "How good was his Spanish in the show" and "Did he sound like he was from Medellin, Colombia at all?"


************Did your parents ever guilt-trip you to eat all of your dinner because there are kids going hungry in Africa? It was so recurrent in my childhood


************Fellow Asian Latin Americans Do you guys even exist? I stumbled upon a travel video of a couple in S√£o Paulo and he was surprised to learn that his partner looked more local than him because she was Asian. I of course already knew that, but people barely know of our existence, so I guess tell us about yourself, what do you go through, what frustrates you, how is your ethnic identity, what are some weirdly specific stuff abou Asians in your country. And if you are from an ethnic group that is not traditionally linked to Latin America tell about it as well.

I don't know where I want to go with this, but I just wanted to know about other Asians in Latin America.


************How screwed would you be living in your country if sea levels rose to 80m according to these maps? What would be your plan? 80m means all ice on Earth melted. This is what our continent would look:

************Americans with Latin American ancestry talking about Latin America as they were Latin Americans. Do you feel they romanticize LatAm? On r/LatinoPeopleTwitter which is made basically by Americans with Hispanic ancestry they blame US intervention in the Cold War for the misery of Latin America nowadays. If they only spent a year in Latin America they would understand that we are as we are because of our own fault.

I think they actually treat US as more important than they actually are and that people from Latin America were unable to do anything by themselves.


************Non-argentinians of LatAm, do you also use this symbol (? when texting to indicate sarcasm? In Argentina, a lot of young people (including me) use this sort of emoji, "(?" at the end of a sentence to express that what we just said was a joke, or is said in a sarcastic or ironic manner.

I was wondering if other spanish speaking countries used it too, because I haven't seen many people outside of Argentina using it.  


EDIT: So, apparently, it's mostly used by us argentines (and uruguayans) and some chileans, and the other latinos who use it got it from talking to argentines. That's interesting! I've no idea where it could've come from or who invented it.


************Peruvians, what's going on? I heard about protests, and Terma, could anybody explain this girl under a stone? Sorry I don't fully know, i never been to Peru, but I've seen some stuff in TN and on instagram, but I don't understand what's happening at all ;-;


************What's your favorite saying in your lenguage? Mine is "m√°s sabe el diablo por viejo que por diablo" or " al pan pan y al vino vino".


************How common is for some Redditor to tell you that they know more about your country than you? Yeah like the question says, it seems like every Redditor magically knows everything about Latam. This one Redditor told me in Colombia women weren't legally existing until the 1991 constitution. Or something even dumber but I'm assuming the least worst case scenario. It's not like they could vote from 1954 onwards or anything üôÑ


************Do you want to write a letter to your future self? Hello! My brother and I (from Argentina) developed a website where you can write a letter to your "future self" which will be sent by mail on the date you specify.

We believe that this is a good reflection exercise to be able to realize how much we change over time, you can give yourself advice and set goals.

In these moments of so much uncertainty it is always good to put time in perspective to focus.

The website is in spanish and most users are from iberoamerica. There is a section where you can read all the letters from the people who selected them to be public (which are really wholesome).  The content of these letters reflect what we as latinos are feeling, our wishes and goals.

We hope you like it, if you want to send your letter this is the link: [www.yodelfuturo.com](http://www.yodelfuturo.com/) :)

PS: I know this is not a question but admins let us post this.

************Is the Mexican nazi wedding at the news in your country? There's a Tlaxcalan couple that made a nazi-themed wedding and it made it into National news. They won't face charges because the constitution doesn't have laws against nazi propaganda, so it is allowed.

************Do most countries celebrate Christmas on the 24th of December and for what reason? Only heard of this tradition very recently and I'm intrigued! I was able to get a sort of overview from Google but nothing in depth.

I did see that the 25th of December is still considered Christmas in the Latin community so have a few questions around that:

Are presents exchanged on the 24th?
Is the main Christmas meal eaten on the 24th?
Is the 25th similar to 'Boxing day' in the UK (26th December - public holiday)

Thanks ‚ò∫Ô∏è


************Who is/was you country's most famous dictator? Are many people still fond of his times? We live in a part of world which history is full of dictatorships. Some of are still relatively well remembered as Peron in Argentina or Fidel Castro in Cuba. In Brazil, Bolsonaro loves to praise military dictatorship.


************I just would like to say i love this sub and i wish we were more like brothers... Um salve de um Brasileiro ! üòâ‚ù§Ô∏è

Greetings from a Brazilian !


Edit: thanks for all the love you guys/girls are sending, this really warms my heart and gives me hope in the sense that the citizens of these countries think the same as me ! Looks like the love we already have, it‚Äôs only missing the means and the will to make our countries always more closer as the ‚Äúbig family‚Äù we are. 

I do have to point out that when a lot of Argentineans send me this love... this is really a barrier-braker !! (Hahah just a joke ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è)

Edit2: more love has been sent.. and i just have to thank.. i love standing behind this flag, i am not a expert but when i think about a integrated LaTam i think we finally started to think in the terms of what really matters.. our people, and less in economical frontiers, political interests, sounds to me that we have much more to win standing together than otherwise, thank you Latam community, i hope every step towards our integralization in the future follows the trail of love,  acts of love are deeper and last longer


************With a population of 40 million people, Argentina produces food for 400 million people, yet has 50% of poverty rate. Do you think there is hope for the country? 


************So What Did Y'all Think of Encanto? I'm curious to what Colombians, and Latin Americans in general, thought of Encanto. Did it work for you, why or why not? Despite it's fantastical nature did it resonate for you in a way that felt real? Was the music representative of Colombian music to you? I heard one review lament that it was yet again another movie about non white/non Europeam cultures that takes place in a rural, pastoral type setting despite most Latin Americans living in the city. What's your opinion on that? Lastly, do you think it was better than Coco?


************In your country people say "7 de la Tarde" or "7 de la Noche"? 


************Announcement: Cultural Exchange with /r/AskAnAmerican scheduled for January 8th Hello,

We‚Äôd like to announce that we are having a Cultural Exchange with /r/AskAnAmerican in a week and a half from now, on the 8th of January. It is set at 9 AM Eastern United States time. Click [here](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html?iso=20200108T140000&p1=51&p2=155&p3=41&p4=232&p5=99&p6=124&p7=131&p8=190&p9=163) to convert it to your time zone.

**How does it work?** A stickied thread will be created on this sub for the users of AAA to ask us questions. Similarly, a thread will be created on r/AskAnAmerican for us to ask questions to them.

For those unfamiliar with the concept of CEs, we have hosted multiple ones before. There should be a tag "Cultural Exchange" to search back to.


************What Hollywood show has done a decent job depicting Latin America? From all the hollywood shows I've seen, they all depict Latin America as the foreground of crime...

But what Hollywood shows, if any have done a good job promoting countries?

I really enjoyed The Spy with Sacha Baron Cohen that had a tidbit of an Isreali spy making connections in Buenos Aires.

Jack Ryan Season 2, while it didn't depict Venezuela in a positive tone, it was nice to see a show with a new story line.

I wouldn't include Narcos as I have heard it did a poor job depicting the positive side of Colombia and now Mexico.


************Colombians, how do you feel about the Separation of Panama from Colombia? Do you see this as an act of American Imperialism? I was bored at work reading about this subject and I felt so disgusted about the american intervention that I immediately thought of the war of Texas and some other times when the government of the US imposed their interests over the free self-determination of every country... or maybe I am biased in seeing it as a conspiracy. What do you think?


************People call themself "Latino" in your country? In the same way people from the US does Today at the supermarket, a father (maybe in his 40's) ans his son (arround 12 yrs) were in front of me. They were speaking and the son called himself "latino", in the same way people from the US does, and his father burst into laughter after hear him. 
Then he start to make fun of his son, speaking like Daddy Yankee and making pistol hand gestures.

I find it funny becose at least here in Chile, people usually don't use that word to describe themselves.

How is the reality in your country?
Saludos, desde Chile.

************Has Qatar hosting the world cup changed your opinion of the Arab world? Now that we're a week or so into it, what are your thoughts?

Qatar apparently saw hosting the world cup as representative of the Arab world at large, I've heard it called "the Arab World Cup".  

Do you have a desire to visit the Arab world?


************Why does Chile consume so much tea? https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_tea_consumption_per_capita


************Cry for me Argentina So I, a brazilian, was reading about the very interesting economic history of Argentina and how your economy has been minutely analized by economists the world over. The gist I got was everyone tries to understand how Argentina went from being very rich to definitely not very rich since the 20th century as opposed to every other big nation at start of that century. I wanted to know what are your perspectives on that, how the process is taught in schools, and what is the main damper of Argentina's economic growth that still continues to be an issue?


************Did/does Spanish and Portuguese languages spoken in Latin America influence Spanish and Portuguese spoken in Iberia? Kinda like how Americanisms are present in Britain?


************Foreigners that frequent this sub: why? (asking after 2 years again) [1st Edition](https://www.reddit.com/r/asklatinamerica/comments/alrroj/foreigners_that_frequent_this_sub_why/) [2nd Edition](https://www.reddit.com/r/asklatinamerica/comments/kgv336/foreigners_that_frequent_this_sub_why_asking/)


************Does Portuguese sounds "slavic" to you ? I've heard and read everywhere that foreigners think that Portuguese sounds like Russian or another slavic language. From what I've learned, it is common when Brazilians speak Portuguese abroad for locals to think they are speaking Russian.

A lot of Brazilians say this is not true and that only European Portuguese sounds slavic, but I recently found [this guy](https://www.tiktok.com/@spencersabe/video/7024919752585841926?is_copy_url=0&is_from_webapp=v1&sender_device=pc&sender_web_id=7033968210694063621) reproducing how Brazilian Portuguese sounds to non-Portuguese speakers and I realized that it actually sounds kinda slavic.

What do spanish speakers think? And the french, english and Dutch speaker folks that I see lurking around the sub?


************Question to Brazilians: Which lusophone accents inside your country or in the rest of the Lusophere are considered posh/formal and which ones are considered ratchet or hard to understand? People who aren't Brazilians but understand Portuguese can participate too.


************What are vulgar words in your country that mean not so offensive things in other Latin-American (African or Asian Latino) dialects. Im from PR so:

Bicho is the funniest to hear because i think we are the only country\* where it means Cock or Dick.


************Cuban brothers and sisters, how are you accessing Reddit right now? Are you guys using VPN now that the Cuban government blocked access to social media? (might be the right answer??) or it hasn‚Äôt actually banned all or any social media at all? How‚Äôs the situation over there? 

Wish you guys all the best!


************Which languages do you learn in school? In France, we have to learn two languages in school. The first one is english and for the second one we have a choice between spanish or german. Those that want to can learn a third one (usually Italian) but it's not mandatory.

I wonder what it's like for you down there? I imagine learning english must be mandatory but if you do study a second language, which one is it?


************How do I get my gf to understand you can't look Latin American? Basically she always assumes when someone's "white", or is "blonde" or etc, that they can't be Latin American, because they don't look Latin American. I always explain to her that, you can't "look" Latin America, that half of Latin America is "white" and most of Latin Americans descend from spanish colonizers. And ontop of that, that the Irish Celts migrated from Iberia, aka Spain and Portugal.

But she still doesn't get it through her head. No matter how many time i explain to her, but she's stuck in this WASP way of thinking, and i just don't understand how to get her to understand. She's part Nicaraguan too, her mom was born in Nicaragua, but moved here when she was 1, during the 80s war, so her mom's Anglicized too.

How do I explain to her in a way she understands? It's really annoying as I'm Nicaraguan myself


************What are things typically associated with Mexico that are actually from elsewhere in Latin America? For example, El Chupacabras Is From Puerto Rico but Anglo people incorrectly attribute it to Mexico. I've also read people claim that cumbia is Mexican lmao.


************Saw a thread about annoying types of gringo. What can I do to not be an annoying gringo? 


************"Indigenous people are evolving. Each day the are becoming more like human beings, just like us." If you don't already know who said this abomination, which latin american politician would you guess is the source of this quote. "Indigenous people are evolving. Each day the are becoming more like human beings, just like us."


************About Spain and Portugal. I'm Brazilian and i think I would never go to Portugal in my life. I have the impression (and I've seen many reports) that those people hate us and don't want us there. Do the Hispanic hermanos feel the same about Spain?


************Non-Latin people who come to this sub, but who have Spanish or Portuguese as a second language, how much do you understand Portuguese or Spanish? These languages ‚Äã‚Äãare very similar, and a native man can turn around to understand the other. I wanted to know how a person who had to learn Spanish or Portuguese can understand the other language that they have never studied, spoken or written.


************Do you think that all Americans could embrace a Pan-American identity someday? Do you feel a connection to gringos through the idea of a shared American continent? Anyway I‚Äôm kind of drunk so this could get deleted but it‚Äôs okay. So I really do think that us US-Americans have a lot more in common with Latin Americans than people think but there are obvious political barriers. But having lived in Colombia and Ecuador, and having visited Mexico, Guatemala, Costa Rica, Panama, and Peru, and I truly believe that we have a lot in common. Seriously I‚Äôm always telling my friends that Latin America is great and Colombians are so accepting and cool even if I have a strong gringa accent. 

I want to send a message of love to all the Latin Americans and more and more I want all US-Americans and Canadians to embrace being a single continent. I‚Äôm honestly not sure why we are taught to separate the continents but to be honest, ever since I‚Äôve thought about the American continent, I feel closer to my American brothers and sisters, from Canada to Chile. The border starting at Mexico feels like a veil that has covered so many potential connections I could have with other people who have a lot in common with us. In the US we are so wrapped up in our identities as ‚ÄúAmericans‚Äù that we don‚Äôt recognize the people that view North and South America  as one.

I swear that this came from the heart aka my drunken brain. My real question is if you feel a connection with gringos through the idea of a shared continent - do you feel that we have a similar history and even culture? What do you mean when you say we are all Americans? I think that most gringos would say we are culturally closer to Europe when I honestly believe we are closer to Latin America. What do you think about this?


************What are the most famous mandela effects (false memories) in your country The most famous one in Brazil is that the 9/11 breaking news had interrupted a Dragon Ball episode in which Majin Boo was dueling Goku

************M√©xico has the Day of the Dead, Brazil has the Rio Carnival; what does your country have? Does your country have some big cultural event of festival that is celebrated by the whole country?


************What's the dumbest thing that someone trying to speak English told you? I got two from the same friend, he wanted to search on TY  "You Can't Touch This - MC Hammer", so he wrote in the search bar "emci jamer" he found the song, since that day we call him "emci"   


The other one, he was all day searching for a song in google, he wrote in the search bar "batuflay" I didn't even know what he wanted to search so when he started to sing i recognize the song "I Believe I Can Fly". I'm still laughing of that.


************How much Spanish does a gringo (US American) have to know to not be considered "cringe"? (I've only heard this from a select few amount of people legit from Latin America and most of those select few live or have lived in the US, so i dont mean all "Latin Americans think a gringo speaking Spanish is cringe")

but I am wondering how much Spanish should an individual know in order not to be considered cringe because I'd assume if someone is at least trying to learn the language it should be fine no matter how bad their accent or something is. Or can you guys tell the difference between someone that is actually learning and someone that's just messing around and not learning at all?

EDIT: Or Portuguese, almost forgot about Brazil lol


************Is anime big in Latin America? 


************Countries in the southern hemisphere, how do you feel about globalised media being based on northern hemisphere seasons? Bonus question: If you moved between the hemispheres, did you have any kind of geographical culture shock from the seasons getting reversed?


************Announcement: from now on, "Latinx" is the preferred pronoun on this subreddit Hello my fellow Latinxs,

5,600 subscribers and counting. What a long way we've come!

Due to the spectacular growth of our community, we've felt the need to move more towards an accepting, neutral language. Which is why we're officially embracing the term "Latinx". It is now the preferred pronoun to be used on this subreddit.

I'm sure the community feels that we adhering this was long overdue. Which was the main thing taken in consideration when making this decision.

Have a good week, Latinxs,

Latinx u/DarkNightSeven 


************Why is Latin America not taken seriously on the global stage? Latin America has made contributions & acheivements worth emulating, but these receive little to no recognition. Also why are LATAM countries sidelined or seen as junior partners when it comes to Intragovernmental organizations? 

for example:

Uruguay's initial success in managing COVID-19 was largely ignored in global discussions compared to European and Asian responses.

Brazil‚Äôs bid for a permanent seat on the UN Security Council has been largely dismissed despite its regional influence.

Latin America's efforts in pioneering universal healthcare models, such as Cuba's medical diplomacy, are often overlooked in global health discussions dominated by Western systems.

Argentina's early debt restructuring successes in the early 2000s were dismissed by global financial institutions, even though it became a popular model for later debt crisis management.

Chile's advancements in renewable energy, particularly solar power, receive little global recognition despite being one of the world's top solar energy producers.


************What's the craziest conspiracy theory you've heard in your country? In the DR we are currently on a census and some people are saying it's part of a plan by the international community to unify Haiti and the Dominican Republic (no idea how they linked those two things)


************Thoughts on Spanish King refusing to stand up to Sim√≥n Bol√≠var's sword at Colombian Presidential ceremony? [https://twitter.com/gener\_usuga/status/1556541189779820544](https://twitter.com/gener_usuga/status/1556541189779820544)


************How offended do you usually get when Americans assume that Latin America is an extension of Mexico? Personally, I got mad after a meeting with a group of students of North Carolina during a subject in the English teaching course in which they asked us if we drank Tequila. I was like "No you dumbass, that's a Mexican Practice, not Argentinean."


************Do you think its odd to eat lasagna with rice? Its common in Brazil to eat [lasagna with rice](https://www.receitas-sem-fronteiras.com/uploads/media/86139_highlight-25.jpg?1393608928)


************How common are men with long hair in your country? How are they perceived by society? At a hindsight, when I think of my highschool years, I realize that my school had a lot of dudes with long hair for whatever reason. There were like 50 of them lol. And it wasn't related to music scenes like rock or heavy metal, it was just guys that just randomly had very long hair. When I went to the university, I also noticed a substantial amount of guys with long hair. 

I wouldn't say it's the norm here but it is common enough to be noticable and people generally don't have a problem with it.


************What are some good Spanish-speaking youtubers? I'm trying to follow more Spanish-speaking youtubers, but I'm having a difficult time finding good channels and I figure y'all will know best.


************Today is the birthday of Alberto Santos Dummont, undisputed inventor of the airplane :P If Latin America had its way, which inventions or stuff would be atributed to us? - Portuguese/Brazilian Bartolomeu de Gusm√£o would be credited as the inventor of the airship in 1709
- Brazilian Santos Dummont would be rightfully recognized as the true inventor of 14-bis, the first true airplane in 1906 (unlike [the fraud brothers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=povGggaIK2A) :P)
- Mexican Guillermo Gonz√°lez Camarena would be recognized as the inventor of color television in 1940
- German/Brazilian Andreas Pavel the true inventor of the Stereo Belt, the first portable music player in 1972, not Sony with their walkman

And that's the only cases I know, are there more Latin Americans who are overshadowed by American, European or Japanese inventors?


************why do latin-americans paint latin america as the worst thing ever? honestly, as a brazilian born and made, it is a bit dystopian how latin-americans complain so much about latin america and talk about us like if we're similar to the sub saharan africa.

the poorest country i've ever been to was egypt, and even the capitals lost in infrastructure and organization to any average city in brazil.

i went to india some years ago, and the misery i saw in that place is on another level when compared to the misery brazilians face. when i came back, i talked about the misery to a lot of brazilians and other latin-american friends, and they all said "oh but you don't know brazil or x latin-american country well, we have all of that here", and i've traveled a lot of brazil, i've been to the poorest places of this country. 

while there is extreme poverty here, it is 1000x worse there. firstly, quantitatively. only the HUGE concentration of poverty due to the immense population is already a huge problem. for example, on basic sanitation, that is basically non-existent in some places there, the difference is shocking. here in brazil, a city may not have basic sanitation or adequate cleanliness to a poorer fraction of the population, which causes inadequate garbage disposal in some places, like in wastelands or rivers, or in some random places of a street. but there, there's garbage and trash to every place you go. there's so much poverty with no infrastructure that even a big city basically becomes a dump. i was extremely shocked with the insurmountable and extreme amount of trash. i remember hopping on a bus from a city to another, and for hours during the route, there was literally one meter of garbage in each border of the street/road. 

and also, we have intense government support to poor people here, while three, it seems like there's not a minimal effort to change anything to the poor people reality, and that they're a completely excluded population from the non-poor people. the feeling of inequality there is quantitatively different.

i spent a week in bangalore. i saw a group searching for trash on the way back to the hotel. between 'em, a naked guy, fully covered in dirt, crooked teeth, hair to the feet and eating something that looked like rotten food straight from the street's ground. yes, the same thing can happen in brazil, but the immensity, the intensity, and the place is another total thing! this was not the favela of a city, this was the city's downtown and rich part!

a french friend of mine went to buy something with a hawker, and she literally PEED while selling shit to him. it doesn't matter what is the situation, no one here would ever have to work until you pee.

i also went to chenai and its roundings on the south. i remember getting out of a mall in the city's downtown, and there was a group of people offering some transport service. all of 'em didn't have one or the two legs, they dragged themselves through the city's ground (literally covered in dirt), going after clients. the transport they used was a horse-drawn cart. i don't even know how the hell they managed to use it, but it must've been on brutal strength. no crutch or any wheelchair, and everyone was almost naked except for a few skirts some guys used.

brazil has a lot of problems, but you'll never see this. a person with physical limitations like this would receive guaranteed financial and legal support from the government, even if not huge, to not ever have to work again. and if you want to work to have more money, the government will give you a crutch or a wheelchair.

i've been to favelas in brazil, i've been to indigenous tribes in the far north. i grew up in bahia and my grandparents lived in the classic sert√£o nordestino, and i never saw anything quite like i saw in india. people in the sert√£o nordestino which are basically the ultimate poverty in the region and people there have access to water, electricity, almost everyone owns a car or a motorcycle, and it's pretty rare to see anyone starving too for a long time now.

i remember when i was in frankfurt, germany, one time, waiting for the bus to go to another part of the city, and a really old lady, clearly an immigrant from some muslim country, raised her skirt in front of everyone, benched a bit and peed in front of everyone. evidently bathroom wasn't lacking in frankfurt, it's really a cultural thing.

yes, we are some decades behind europe in various aspects, but compared to the majority of the world, we're doing fine. people don't understand that the norm of the world is poverty, not richness. then you hear someone complaining about latin-american countries being classified as "upper-middle income countries". it's like we've been told so much that we're poor and underdeveloped as fuck that we strongly believe it. there's no comparison between africa and asia and brazil of the countries i visited, i felt in norway after coming back.

and by the way, this also includes myself. i constantly complain about brazil, my city and say that i have no hope for the future of our nation.


************reminder to people visiting this subreddit. ‚ÄòLatinos‚Äô in the USA are not the same as ‚ÄòLatin Americans‚Äô. Questions about Latinos in the USA are more appropriate for r/AskAnAmerican not this subreddit. because they are americans. not latin americans. 

cheers.

************Aside from the language, what else sets Brazil apart from its hermanos? By browsing this sub I also get the feeling that native culture (and language) are a greater part of daily life in most other Latam countries.


************In English, the word ‚Äúbed‚Äù actually looks like a bed. Are there any words in your language that make an image of the object it is trying to represent? 


************What can you buy with $20 USD in your country? I remember a couple months ago I was talking with a friend in Brazil who had a craving for something. So I offered to send her some money to buy it. I sent her $20 USD which was like a 100 Reals in Brazil.  She got upset with me because apparently that was significantly a lot more money than she needed. So that memory got me thinking how much value is $20 USD in your currency and what could you buy with it?


************Is there colorism when it comes to acceptance of immigrants in your country? i.e. immigrants that are lighter skinned get treated better. 


************Have you ever been to therapy?  I've seen a therapist for specific periods of my life and it's been really helpful and definetly helped me work through some tough times. 

Whats your country's attitude towards therapy and mental health in general? I'd say that in Argentina, or at least in Buenos Aires, it is quite normalized to see a therapist, as our country is known for having the highest number of psychologists per capita in the world.


************News from the Revolution! Hello, r/asklatinamerica users, 

Almost a year ago in this very sub an amazing process started. Those of you that were here might remember: the revolt we started to take back r/LatinAmerica. And, boy, take it back we did and in the most Latin-American way. 

As soon as we instituted the Perfectly Democratic Military Junta and seized the power of moderation, we started to build r/LatinAmerica into the community long desired envisioned by the revolutionaries from r/asklatinamerica. It‚Äôs from the depths of our hearts that we in the PDMJ thanks the r/asklatinamerica community as a whole and its mod team in particular, without you it wouldn‚Äôt have been possible such a quick and bloodless take over. We also come with news of what the revolution has archived in these past few months.   

There have been many moments of disbelief and hardship, even we had some casualties a long the way, in spite of that, a lot has been accomplished by the users of r/LatinAmerica. We started weekly thematic threads, have had commemorative posts and special banners for the Independence Days of several Latin-American countries, updated the look of the sub, including side-maps with the countries infected by covid-19, executed the very special April fool‚Äôs joke and managed to reach whooping 5000 subscribers.

We have still a long way to go but rest at ease, while that desire to have a welcoming community that guided us all to such a glorious revolution exists progress will be, if not inevitable, at least possible. So we say with the might of the lungs of 5000 persons: ‚ÄúJoin us in this fascinating process that is building a community!‚Äù

************Where does Latin America's reputation for promiscuity come from? Why are stereotypes like "Latinas/os are easy", so rampant in the world? Genuinely curious... 


************Congratulations r/asklatinamerica for 100k members We did it


************update on Castillo He has been impeached and was arrested along with his family en route to the Mexican embassy, who were going to fly him and his family to safety in Mexico.

Good news for Peruvian democracy!


************Why USA people are so cold? As a latinamerican I have no issues with physical contact with family or friends, in fact I enjoy it really much and it seems to be part of our culture. But I just don't unterstand why in the USA they are so cold at each other, but like really cold, the hugs seem akward, and I don't understad why, why they're so cold with their relatives or close friend, or maybe it's just a stereotype I have.


************The British loves the Spanish but the Spanish hates the British. What LATAM countries shows any one sided Love to another LATAM country ? Many British sees the Spanish way of life as better (the food , the weather , the attractiveness of the people ) and Spain is the favourite destination of many British tourist. They dont see Spain as rivals or an enemy despite Gibraltar. 

Many Spanish on the other hand sees the UK as their historic rival with France and many hates the British because of the tourist and see them as disrespectful think The Brit looks down them because of how they act in Spain and how they refuse to integrate in their culture such as learning Spanish and calling themselves Expats. 


What LATAM country loves another country but dont love them back?


************So Russia invaded more territory of Ukraine. Thoughts? 


************Have you seen the Twitter trend #ShutUpGringo2022? Opinions? Apparently it stemmed from a gringo criticizing a Japanese artist for a fan art where he didn‚Äôt make the main character from Encanto‚Äôs skin dark enough. 

Too harsh? Appropriate? 

Link: https://mobile.twitter.com/search?q=%23shutupgringo2022


************What are the names of games you played as a kid? In Colombia, "tag" is "lleva" and "hide and seek" is "escondite". How are those (or other similar games) called where you are from? Also, whenever we wanted to pause, we would say "tai" or "tacho", is it the same in your country?


************How important is the preservation of native languages for you? Do you think they should be recognized as an official language? Do you think they should be taught at schools? Do you think language preservation is an urgent issue in the region?

If you don't speak a native language, do you have the intention to learn one (maybe the one that was spoken by your parents or grandparents)?

If you think this is important what ideas do you have to better preserve these languages?


************Why don't we call ourselves Roman America instead of Latin America? Feels way more badass


************Are any of you from or have you ever visited Suriname, Guyana or French Guiana? I'm curious about those countries because here in Peru nobody knows what happens there. I would like to know how are their people, what do they think of the rest of Southamerica and how they consider themselves as a part of our continent and at the same time being so left apart.

And why are they so left appart from the rest of us?


************I have a question, do you genuinely, unironically, hate The U.S ? 


************Which town have Gringo or European taken in your country Here it‚Äôs Boquete Panama a highland town. This town you will find all types of crazies from very deep left wing to very deep right wing. These people will go around telling you they are citizens of the world. Some are here to find themselves spiritually and run ayahuasca retreat to scam other white people. A home here will set you back 300k to 1 million +. Very beautiful place though. Has a solid night life and lots of things to do but people from there just turn me away.

Another place is Pedasi prob more quiet and laid back beach town. Also even more expensive. Here you will find more Europeans. Michael Jordan, Jennifer Aniston and a few other famous people own homes here. Would def live here if there was more to do.


************What's a country that claims to be ''Totally not like the US'' and a friend to LATAM but has been evil the whole time? 


************Which places in Latin America are known for quality healthcare? I am looking to take a trip abroad mainly for medical purposes due to the ridiculous prices in the United States. I have a rotator cuff injury that I need medical assistance with and I‚Äôm looking for any cities or countries you would recommend for having quality healthcare.

I was thinking Mexico City but I‚Äôm open to suggestions as well. Thanks in advance.


************Costa Ricans and Panamanians, given that your countries don't have an actual Army (yet an small paramilitary forces instead), how does it feel like? Is there a sentiment to want it back? 


************How do you think we can dispel myths and misconceptions of Latin America? Recently a couple friends and I planned a Mexico City trip, and several friends were onboard. People began cancelling after thinking too much or reading the news. Despite what we told them about Mexico City being a nice city and the people being wonderful, they kept thinking it was going to be like Zona Norte in Tijuana. No amount of explaining I could do can convince them that not all of Mexico is like the neighborhood around Hong Kong Club in TJ, which is all they know. One friend who is going keeps acting like we‚Äôre going to Iraq and keeps treating the trip like a life ending adventure. 

Same went for Panama and Colombia trips in the past, when other people refused to go, because they kept thinking about Pablo Escobar, Noriega, cartels, and slums. None of them would even watch the travel videos I sent them, thinking they were going to waste their time. My future mother in law won‚Äôt even visit San Diego, because she thinks it‚Äôs too close to Latin America and therefore dangerous.


************Announcement: Cultural Exchange with /r/Quebec scheduled for January 22th Hello,

We‚Äôd like to announce that we are having a Cultural Exchange with /r/Quebec on the 22th of January. It is set at 9 AM Montr√©al time.

**How does it work?** A stickied thread will be created on this sub for the Qu√©b√©cois to ask us questions. Similarly, a thread will be created on r/Quebec for us to ask questions to them.

For those unfamiliar with the concept of CEs, we have hosted multiple ones before. There should be a tag "Cultural Exchange" to search back to.

We had a great exchange with /r/AskAnAmerican! Thank you users for making that possible.


************What is your favorite favorite food from your country? Personally i love Tlayudas, they are like Prehispanic pizza.

a super large tortilla, covered with tasajo (salted beef) avocado, salsa verde, chorizo, etc.

footnote: yesterday i asked something really seriorans semi political semi phylosofical about what is race, so lets forget that and focus on aspects we all like about our culture.

that and im really happy to see how you all responded to that post, many explained it to me in a really friendly way, this is truly agreat community.


************Argentina has reach a deal with creditors and has likely avoided default. What do you think of this? Argentina has reached a deal with its creditors. According to some sources, the deal comes with a 45% *haircut*, meaning that Argentina will pay USD 55 for every USD 100 of owed debt.

I think this is good for Argentina and the region. Argentina is having very serious economic difficulties and a default would have been fatal not only to them, but to all of us. This is positive and the only positive economic aspect of Alberto's presidency until now. A lot of Argentinians will hate me for this, but that's my opinion.

Now, don't tell me this fixes all of Argentina's problems. No. They still to make changes to fiscal, financial, monetary and commercial policies.

I also heard Ecuador restructured its debt. I still don't have the details, but you can also share those details if you have them.

************Made a playlist with the most iconic native american andean songs. Perfect for those trying to get into indigenous south american music. What do you guys think? [Here's the playlist ](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0tn4dSMKZuR97fVVCXq7ET?si=XcfXKobST_SIYE3iPZktbg)


************Brazilians, if you had to move for another country of South America, which one would you choose? 


************Question to Hispanics: Do you call Brazilians "Brasile√±os" or " Brasileros"? 


************[MOD POST] New rule to be trialled in the subreddit: use of tag "LatAm friendly" allows discussion and answers to be in Spanish and Portuguese Although this is being called a "new rule", this is more an exception to rule 2, which says that top level comments (answers) must be in English in order to accomodate non Latin Americans who do not speak our languages. In the specific threads where this tag is used, rule 2. will not be enforced. 

We only ask that this tag be used reasonably, and not just for any random question that OP comes up with. Mod discretion might be applied to determine whether the tag is being "abused" or not. In reality, we'll see how this plays out with time, while the rule is under trial.

We made a flair to identify this type of thread, "LatAm friendly". u/AutoModerator pins a comment to remind people of this rule. From now on, any user can tag their post with the flair, and their thread will not have to abide by rule 2.

This is a response to a community claim that was raised in the census, since a few users mentioned how they wish there would be more integration among our own users, this rule looks to build stronger connection between them, since they will be free to use their native languages (and variations).


************Does your president speak any other languages? Edit: almost everyone made the exact same joke, and I love it


************Brazilian Redditors , what happens if I don't "come to Brazil".. I'm interested in this because my friend wears this shirt that says " please come to Brazil" on the front ...


************So according to the census of this sub, most people are left-wing: For those of you who are not left-wing, How would you describe yourself politically? Do you feel like you can't express your views on this sub? 


************How big are African-American religions in your country? (Except Brazil) As a Brazilian that has a small degree of approximation with different Afro-Brazilian religions, I've been thinking a lot about the many variations of African-American religions throughout Latin America and I'd like to ask how big are they in your country and how much of an influence in the general culture.  Here there are many many different religions and variations (Umbanda, Candombl√©, Tambor de Mina, Xang√¥ de Pernambuco, Batuque, Quimbanda.....) and they play a big role in many aspects of our culture (specially in music!) even if they're only really practiced by a small minority. I've heard a lot about Cuba, of course, but I'm curious about the other countries. Thanks everyone!


************How widespread is the use of the word 'gringo' in Latin America? In northern Latin America, I suppose it's widespread. But what about farther south?

PS. It's not a derogatory term, it's just the denonym for people from the USA because we all know 'Americans' is incorrect.


************What nationality have you been mistaken for? Also what nationality you wouldn‚Äôt care people mistaking you as? Bonus question: 


what nationality you call someone as a joking insult? 


Me and my friends use Miami Cubans as one. 

Miami Cubans( not all) do not equal Cubans in Cuba. 

No hate.


************Dear Bolivians and Paraguayans, how do you feel about the fact that, very likely, no whale knows your country's territory exists? 


************Remove rice, beans, and plantains and you just killed like 70% of the dishes in most countries in latin america... Is this comment true? I know this wouldnt apply to Peru or Mexico since they have so much variety of dishes but what about other countries?


************If you had a budget of $100 million USD (think Marvel superhero movie budget) to film and release a movie set in your country, what would the movie be about and where would it be set? 


************Cual es su opini√≥n sobre Jorge Arbusto? Tambi√©n conocido como George Bush


************How is the Roman Empire viewed in Latin America? In my country, as well as the other Romance speaking European countries the Romans are viewed as our ancestors and people take pride in our Roman heritage, in fact, in my country we even learn Latin in school, but how do people in Latin America view it when they speak a Romance language despite having never been part of the Roman Empire?


************In your opinion, who has been the most important person in your country‚Äôs history & why? 


************Why do you think there are so many posts asking about the 'hottest women'? It seems like every day someone is asking about which country has the hottest women, why Brazilian women have the best butts, how to pick up Colombian women, etc. 

Why do you think people have this obsession with the 'hotness' of Latin American women? Is it over-sexualisation in Latin American culture? Beauty pageants? Some 'exotic Latina' fetish?


************Do you know "sana sana" song? Did your relatives ever sang this to you:

>*Sana, sana, colita/culito de rana, si no sana hoy, sanar√° ma√±ana*

when you were hurt?

Different versions exist but the structure remains the same.

I am trying to track  where is this song popular and what is its origin, if you have any information please let me know.

Edit: I am guessing it is a Spanish song

Edit2: *culito* added

Edit3: This post got a hundred upvotes, thanks everybody, this is quite a feedback. For those that are seeing the post for the first time, do you know anything about the origin of this song?


************I'm very ignorant on this subject... Why is Lula such a controversial figure? Seems like Bolsonaro was pretty radical in his own ways but I don't remember the same level of chaos and protest when he was elected. Like I said, I'm ignorant on the subject and don't really have a dog in the race.  I'm just trying to understand.


************Argentinians, Uruguayans and Ga√∫chos, how is the heatwave going? I just saw that a lot of people in Argentina are out of power in this time, I hope you're okay  


Edit: Sorry catarineses and Paraguayans, didn't know the heatwave reached up there x.x can't edit the title now


************Is there a Portuguese word or phrase that is often brought when talking about Brazil in your country? For example, when talking about Argentina and Argentines we, from Brazil, usually use *hermano* [we consider them our little brother] or *boludo* [because they say it all the time].


************If Columbus name is Spanish is Cristobal Colon, shouldn't the country be called Colonia, and not Colombia? 


************What's a commonly held opinion about your country on this subreddit that you disagree with? Let's make a rule just to make sure the answers don't become boring: Please try to **not** answer along the lines of "this sub is too left/right wing for my taste" or "I'm right/left and I hold X common right/left opinion", unless you do believe you can make such answer to be unique, non-agressive and interesting. Or else it would make for boring and repetitive answers.

I'll put my own opinion in the comments just to get the ball rolling


************El Salvadorians, what's the situation like in your country right now? What's happening? What's the reaction? It's being reported right now that, with a pro-government majority in congress, judges in El Salvador's supreme court have been removed from their positions.

Here in Brazil the reaction online has been with a few hardcore Bolsonaristas applauding the move and saying "El Salvador is a country that really listens to it's people", indicating that it should be a example to be followed here in Brazil, as dissatisfaction from the current government with the extent of the supreme courts power and It not backing the executive's agenda is high, but the reaction seems to be, at the moment, mostly from centrists and leftists denouncing the action as authoritarianism and a concentration of power in the hands of the executive, some calling it a coup (Idk if the government has said if it will restore the judiciary's/ supreme court's  powers, but it seems likely they'll stack it if they do). So I'd like to know to opinions of El Salvadorans on the matter


************Question to Argentines, Mexicans and Brazilians: How would you feel if your countries balkanized? What would realistically be the impact on the population and which states/provinces would thrive? So this is a purely speculative scenario but imagine if it did happen what would be the pros and cons? Can it actually happen to begin with?


************Are people thinking of leaving whatsapp in your country? And are they choosing signal or telegram? 


************What are the subtle ways you would "torture" someone from X Latin American country? For example, I figured a great way to torture someone from Mexico would be to ask them:

Hey, could you cook us something traditional from Mexico? But make it not spicy, I'm allergic


************How often do you use ‚Äúojal√°‚Äù and where are you from? Edit: I seem to be getting downvoted, oops. Maybe a stupid question, but I‚Äôm a language learner and my first instinct is usually to say ‚Äúespero que‚Äù when I hope something is going to happen. Didn‚Äôt know if ‚Äúojal√°‚Äù was more frequent, or a Spain word, because the first time I heard it in natural speech was during a conversation with a person from Spain.


************Do people in your country also cheer when there's a blackout, or is it just a Brazilian thing? Like you can hear all the houses in the street going WOOO or YAAAY, and then everyone does it all over again when the lights come back on.

It just happened in my city and I started wondering if this was a thing in other places.

(Whoa, thanks for the award ‚ù§Ô∏è)


************Â§ßÂÆ∂Â•Ω r/asklatinamerica! Hello latinxs of r/asklatinamerica! 

We are glad to announce that we joined a growing list of communities that are affiliated with Tencent Holdings Ltd. As you may know, Tencent is one of the conglomerate "superpowers" in the fields of media and technology. 

We are also making this announcement for another reason. 

With the guidance Tencent's community managers, we have decided to remove any mentions of certain sensitive topics. We hope you understand that this is done not out of censorship, which we find abhorrent, but to not allow the spread of evil propaganda.

************What is your opinion of the cliche/stereotype/fetishization/exotification of the "happy and colorful poor"? I am an immigrant in Brazil. I have noticed that visitors/bloggers often comment that poor people in Brazil are "happy and colorful" despite often dire living conditions. I think they take a favela tour and see some residents grilling meat in front of their house, drinking beer,  listening and dancing to music. Then they come to this conclusion. I also think the media is to blame. And maybe the government wants to portray this image, so that they don't have to take any concrete steps to tackle poverty head-on. 

Is there some truth to this? I have never seen poverty in, say,  the USA or England portrayed this way.


************Do you remember "Pinguinos"? It was a sort of cupcake made out of chocolate with a white filling inside it. It tasted really good, but it's been almost 7 years since I last ate it and I only remembered its existence some minutes ago. You guys also remember it?


************Do you think Latin Americans tend to have an overly Utopian (and simplistic) view of Canada and Europe? Why do you think so? 


************What‚Äôs your least favorite Latin American country and why? 


************Panama is about to legalize cannabis for medical use. Is it legal in your country for medical or recreational use? I'd like to know the legality of cannabis in other Latin American countries. I personally think this is great because it could be a source of income (non-tax source of income) now that we are facing this economic crisis and because a lot of people need it.

************I'm requesting your time üòî \*\***I reached the number of participants needed. Im so grateful for everyone who participated! Thank you for your help** r/asklatinamerica!  This survey will closed soon! I got so many responses from latin america! I barely had any before and now I have hundreds! Much love :)

I hope this is ok to post here. I'm a student and I currently write my bachelor thesis. For that, I'm conducting an international survey and I thought it went pretty well, but now my prof told me that I will fail if I don't find a lot more participants ‚òπ It is especially hard for me to find participants from latin america. If you could please take \~15 minutes of your time and take the survey I would really appreciate it and it might save my ass. The survey is about intercultural differences in perceiving emotions in chat messages, is completely anonymous and you have to rate emojis. If you have suggestions where to reach more participants from latin america Im very grateful.

************Why some native Latin Americans put ketchup on your pizza... its already has tomato sauce My uruguayan and  Mexican friends both did this in a NYC Italian pizza place ... the Italian owner saw this and his face was like if someone bitch slapped his mom .I'm surprised he didn't kick us out .


************What are the not-so-obvious signs someone from your country is economically privileged? 


************Do most people in your country see themselves as victims of colonizers or as the descendants of colonizers? 


************Is my reason to learn Spanish bad? This is a semi joking and serious post so keep that in mind. 

I want to learn to speak and read Spanish so bad because I want to know Who is talking shit about me and my Haitian nationality. So that I can defend myself and my people.

For some background I grew up around a lot of Spanish speakers, listen and Watch some Spanish media, and most of my coworkers are Spanish speakers. 

So I can understand some bad words. And understand when they are saying something bad about Haitians.

But online it‚Äôs a different story. I use google translate Spanish to English to understand sometime, but I feel like I miss a lot of things because I don‚Äôt really understand Spanish. 

You wouldn‚Äôt believe the amount of hate I find and been said to me just for being Haitian. 

I have other reasons to learn Spanish but defending my nationality is the biggest one. 

Is it really bad that I use this to motivate me to learn Spanish?


************Do people from other 3rd world countries outside latam get surprise by your country not being as poor as they think? 
Wife went to a University where they had English lessons. There was a day where people would share pictures from their country. She took pictures from Panama City and many Africans were shocked  that Panama had high rises and lots of luxury cars. So we‚Äôre some Eastern European but they weren‚Äôt as in your face about it.


************Uruguayans and Argentines (and perhaps to a lesser extent Brazilians too) are there any Italianisms present in the culture? Now I‚Äôm not asking if anyone of Italian descent identifies as Italian, because we already know the answer to that lol. I‚Äôm just curious if you guys use any words, phrases, mannerisms, insults, etc. that originally came from Italian.

Just a random curiosity I had, I hope that you guys don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm a stunnad or somethin‚Äô ‚úãüèª


************How are the 10,000 Haitians that crosses the Rio grande into Texas being reported in your country? An not going to lie but as a Haitian, I feel humiliated when I saw the many news reports about those illegal Haitian migrants that ended up in Texas. 

From the many Haitian news I watch and read these migrates are largely from Brazil, Chile, and Mexico. That ended up in those countries after the 2010 Haitian earthquake.

But they idolize the USA so much that they couldn‚Äôt stay in Brazil, Chile, and Mexico or even go back home. They all had decent lives in those countries but no they want to come to the USA and Canada.

Now all of the 10,000 migrants are getting deported back to Haiti. I find that it so funny and humiliated.

Am not being cruel at all. Let me tell you guys about Haiti a little bit.

Haiti is actually one of the safest country in the Caribbean and Latin America. As long as you don‚Äôt live in some neighborhoods in the capital gang crime doesn‚Äôt reach you at all. The rest of Haitian cities are relatively peaceful. Compare that to those gangs control areas they had to walk to reach the USA. 

Haitian are not escaping violence, lack of money, or hunger. They just all want to strike it rich lol. Thinking if they ended up in the USA they will strike gold.


************Hispanics, Do you listen to Brazilian music? If so, What are your favorite artists/songs?

************Is your country experiencing a religious shift? Here in Brazil, catholics used to be [83% of the population in 1991](http://www.ihu.unisinos.br/eventos/563863-uma-projecao-linear-da-transicao-religiosa-no-brasil-1991-2040) and a [2019 research](https://g1.globo.com/politica/noticia/2020/01/13/50percent-dos-brasileiros-sao-catolicos-31percent-evangelicos-e-10percent-nao-tem-religiao-diz-datafolha.ghtml) estimated that 50% of the population is catholic, while 31% are evangelicals and protestants. There is another estimative that by 2020, [catholicism is no longer the religion of the majority in Brazil](https://veja.abril.com.br/brasil/evangelicos-devem-ultrapassar-catolicos-no-brasil-a-partir-de-2032/), with only 44.9% of adherents. By 2030, the estimative is that the number of evangelicals will surpass the number of catholics. The five most evangelical and less catholic states in Brazil are (2010 data):

* Rio de Janeiro (45,8% of catholics, 29,4% of evangelicals and protestants)
* Rond√¥nia (47,6% of catholics, 33,8% of evangelicals and protestants)
* Roraima (47,9% of catholics, 30,3% of evangelicals and protestants)
* Acre (51,9% of catholics, 32,7% of evangelicals and protestants)
* Esp√≠rito Santo (52,2% of catholics, 33,1% of evangelicals and protestants)

************Why is cycling so popular in Colombia? Olympic gold medals, world class cyclists, and even this song by Shakira and Vives (the most Colombian song I can think of) about a bicycle. Why is cycling so popular in Colombia?


************What is the most awkward or uninformed discussion you had with a foreigner about your country? What is the most blatantly uninformed or just awkward statement or discussion you ever heard from someone from another country about yours?

I'd personally say that it's the times that someone believed we were extremely poor and had no internet, the times they believed we were a first world country, the time they believed we were all nazis, and the many times they believed we spoke Portuguese or Italian instead of Spanish.


************How many people that you know are superstitious or believe in paranormal/magical stuff like ghosts, fortune telling, black cats bringing bad luck, etc.?

************To Latin American ladies: Have you experienced negative prejudice with regards to being from an X country or from Latin America in general? I want to ask about gender-related stereotypes, that go beyond stereotypes about all Latin Americans or Latin American countries.

How common is that? I have only seen it in old books.

************Can you tell someone's nationality/region by their accent when they're speaking English? Assuming they're not a native English speaker, of course.

For example: I live in Taiwan, and in my department, where there are a lot of international students, there are a couple of Mainland Chinese students, I can tell if they're Taiwanese or Mainlander by their accents when they're speaking English, even though both PRC & Taiwanese citizens speak Mandarin.

I'm wondering if this is also the case in LatAm. If you can tell, what are the giveaways? Maybe Argentinians would say "What is shour name?" or "New Shork" or "Mashonnaise"? Something like that. Or the Puerto Ricans also turn some Rs into Ls when they speak English.


************What was the weirdest TV ad that aired in your country? Why? I was checking some old TV ads and found [this jewel](https://youtu.be/cH7qSVwIv40). The ad was funny, but the animatronic hen was creepy and weird as f*ck. Still, it did the job, every Peruvian will remember that pasta brand, even if it no longer exists.

So, what was the weirdest TV ad that was aired in your country?


************How much does the average year in college cost in your country? 


************Jamaicans, why do you thinkJamaica has such a high rate of homicide and crime rate? Sorry if it's a dumb question but I would think that since is not a very large country it would be easier to control crime and homicide.


************What are some must-see places in Chile for tourists? I made a typo in a another deleted post where I wrote "Child" instead of "Chile" and people were asking if I'm a priest lol


************Which countries Spanish is the easiest to understand for a Spanish learner Im learning Spanish and would say I'm pretty decent but I just watched a bad Bunny interview, and couldn't understand anything he said.


************What its something that almost every avarege american have in their house but people in your country dont? For Brazilians it's definitely a dishwasher.In several American series and movies it is common to see dishwashers in the house, but this in Brazil is something extremely expensive. I went on a website that compares prices from different stores and the cheapest dishwasher I found costs 1460 reais, to get an idea, the minimum wage here is 1045 reais.


************Do you think Religion still has too much power in latinoamerica and somehow it is an issue for our development? 


************This Week The Guatemalan President will submit to his peers in Honduras and El Salvador a plan to eliminate customs and the borders between the three nations. What do you think? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOaVo-e4pto

This is his speech. It's a return to Central American unionist rhetoric that has been dead for the better part of the last two centuries. What are your thoughts on this? Do you believe that Central America could reunite within our lifetime?


************Do Argentinians view the song about the French football players being black as racist? And would other Latin Americans view it as such?  

My boyfriend is dark-skinned Brazilian and really feels strongly about this, but I don't speak Spanish so I'm only going off translations. But when Argentina played France in the final last year the song was sung by some fans, and now after Argentina won the Copa America Enzo and some of the other players are also seen singing it.

The translation goes something like:

Listen, spread the word

They play for France

But are from Angola

How nice they are going to run

They are cometravas (don't quite understand this)

Their mom is Nigerian

Their father Cambodian

But passport: French

Seems kind of racist to sing about how another country has a lot of black players on their team. Wanted to know the thoughts of Argentinians, as well as other LATAM people about this.

 


************What is the worst thing that your country has ever done? I recently learned about [La Matanza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Matanza).


************Is Chile a developed nation? Chile is considered to be a High income nation according to the World Bank. According to the UN, Chile has a Human Development Index (HDI) of 0.855, similar  to Latvia and Slovakia which are generally considered to be developed countries.

It also ranks 35th in the World in Life Expectancy, above say Estonia, Czech Republic and unsurprisingly, the USA. It ranks 27th in the Corruption Perceptions Index, better than say Israel, South Korea or Spain.

Then, shall Chile be considered to be a developed nations? If not, then why?

Some possible arguments to not consider Chile as developed would be significant poverty/inequality and dependency on commodities‚Äô exports. But I guess the first argument would also invalidate countries like the USA as developed, and the second would invalidate countries like Australia.


************What's something about your culture that gets mythologized by foreigners? 


************What was your biggest culture shock when visiting another latin american country? 


************Do you feel that Latin Americans are obsessed with the validation of the Anglosphere? e.g. Wanting to see their culture in Hollywood movies or having people from English-speaking countries "react" to their culture on YouTube. 


************Has your country ever had pirates? 


************What type of Latin Americans make you cringe? 


************Latin America is poorer than Northern America, just like Latin Europe (or southern in general) is poorer than the rest of Western Europe. Are there cultural reasons for that? 


************"Brazil and Argentina will work for a common currency for Mercosur, says ambassador after meeting with Haddad" what is your opinion about this? each country will still have its local currency such as real and peso, and one more currency that would be for commercial exchange instead of using the dollar. 

[news here](https://www.riotimesonline.com/brazil-news/mercosur/argentina/argentine-ambassador-reveals-conversation-with-brazilian-minister-of-finance-to-create-a-single-currency-in-mercosur/)

[Brazil reports first Latin American cases of Omicron variant | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/brazil-health-regulator-reports-two-cases-omicron-variant-2021-11-30/)


************When people go to Hawaii, they receive a Lei(garland) when they step out the plane. If your country followed its own version of this tradition what would visitors receive upon arrival? 


************What would be different if we would have been colonized by the British instead of the Spanish/Portuguese 


************What do you know in your country about Guyana, Suriname and French Guiana? in Argentina at least nobody ever talks about those countries, they are like the lost countries of Latin America (I know that French Guiana is not a country) and not to mention that if I ever saw a person from those places, I also never heard a person name those countries, I know absolutely nothing and I am quite curious how is it in every country in Latin America.


************Have you heard of the card game called ‚ÄúTruco‚Äù? I know it is very popular here in Argentina, so I was wondering if it is as popular anywhere else.


************Why is Mexico seemingly so religious and conservative  yet progressive at the same time?  Mexico has legalized gay marriage  and abortion meaning in terms of abortion mexico is more progressive then the US. Why is that? From what I know most of mexico is either catholic in which gay marriage and abortion our both big no nos. Or some type of evangelical protestant  like Pentecostal in which gay marrige and abortion our also big no nos. So how did that happen? 


************Argentina's poverty levels hit 57% of population, a 20-year high in January. Why has poverty increased so drastically in the country ? 


************What exactly should I call myself as a ''mixed'' person My mom immigrated to Canada from Colombia in her 20s. My dad is Canadian (Qu√©bec). I've grown up in Canada speaking Spanish and French at home. I grew up listening to South American media (mostly music/youtube). I was sent to a Spanish speaking kindergarten (Cuban). 

If I describe myself as Colombian, I get people telling me I'm not Colombian enough, which I understand. I've never lived in Colombia but have visited. If I say I'm just Canadian, people say I'm not fully Canadian/Qu√©becois enough. If I call myself half and half, I get people telling me I'm not Colombian enough and that I'm just Canadian. And calling myself Qu√©becois opens up a whole other can of worms

TL;DR : Colombian mother, I born in Canada. I'm not enough of one ''ethnicity'' to call myself anything. I think I'll just call myself a bastard

Edit: I just want to thank people who comment their opinion. I wasn't expecting to get so many comments


************Generally speaking, how separate is Brazil from the rest of Latin America? Brazil is considered a major of part of Latin America as a cultural region (usually defined as being the nations that were historical Iberian colonies, often leaving out the Francophone nations despite being "Latin" technically speaking), but the key difference of course is that Brazil speaks Portuguese, while the rest of Latin America speaks Spanish.

Brazil's history naturally is the one most unlike the others, for while the Spanish speaking nations have unique histories in their own right, it was still tied to the Spanish Empire, but Brazil was tied to the Portuguese Empire. Thus, the way they developed was completely different from the Spanish nations.

So I've wondered, how much separation is there between Brazil and the rest of Latin America, and conversely how close are they despite the differences?


************Imagine an UN resolution that says there are too many countries and each one must merge with a neighbor within a year. Which one would you prefer to join? 


************What is the first picture ever taken in your country? [This](https://i.redd.it/v8pqebeop8f31.jpg) is the first picture ever taken in Colombia, a daguerreotype taken in 1842 in Calle del Observatorio, Bogot√° by french diplomat [Jean Baptiste Louis Gros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Baptiste-Louis_Gros).


************[Self-Promo, mods authorized] When I posted about Latin American fantasy settings a couple months ago, some of you asked me to keep you in the loop when I released a new version of my own... [And here it is!] (https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/oxbz5a/im_proud_to_present_you_with_a_new_world_for_whom/)

This is not the final version yet, but I hope you enjoy it!


************Do people in your country also crave a lot for attention? Every gringo that mentions Brazil on social media is instantly overwhelmed with a lot of Brazilian comments and followers. It looks like Brazilian people are always desperate to hear what gringos think about our country.

I would like to know if that also happens in other countries of Latin America.


************Would you accept to live under a dictatorship that fixes your country's problems or keep living in a democracy that doesn't work? I have mixed feelings because of the situation in El Salvador. On one hand, the judges are not being removed because of corruption or proved crimes, but because they overturned illegal decrees last year. I cannot agree to that.

On the other hand, El Salvador needs huge and drastic changes that cannot wait for bureaucracy.

I supported Nayib when he intervened in the national congress last year (I despise congresses), but this time we are talking about the constitution here.

A lot of people have questioned me because of my support of Alberto Fujimori.

Also, Nayib has not established big economic changes. Debt is extremely high, the government is getting bigger, there's even less economic freedom and the fiscal deficit is very high along with public spending. Economically he's a mess. But he has reduced crime.

Mixed feelings here.


************What do you think are the worst dishes from your country/region? I have seen some questions here in the past asking about what people like about their country‚Äôs (or other countries‚Äô) cuisines, so now I‚Äôm actually curious to see what you might actually hate! 
I‚Äôm from the US and there‚Äôs a lot of things I can think of from my region that I feel are pretty awful (e.g. shrimp & grits), so I imagine it would have to be the same for others where there‚Äôs those dishes that you absolutely /loathe/ but can never quite seem to escape.

edit: it seems people REALLY fucking hate morcilla and anything to do with cow stomach

another edit: i think it‚Äôs funny out of all the responses i‚Äôve gotten, not a single one seems to be from a peruvian ‚Äî that‚Äôs gotta be one hell of a flex considering peru‚Äôs culinary reputation !

edit: i summoned the peruvians. it appears not everything is perfect over there.

final edit: it seems mondongo (or menudo) /is/ possibly the most hated food on this subreddit! 
morcilla makes a close, controversial second.


************how do you feel about getting confused with mexicans and does this happen that often? (absolutely nothing against mexicans y'all are cool) a lot of people have asked me if im Mexican just because i talk spanish, its not that big of a deal but it can be annoying sometimes, does this happen often to y'all?

gotta clarify that the annoying part its when people say stuff like "taco taco sombrero ese "


************Why is latin america so LGBT friendly? Latin americans are often portraied as fanatic catholics yet they seem to be very accepting towards homosexuality. For example, in most of the latin american countries gay marriage is legal while in half of the european countries such thing is still completely illegal. How is latin america so advanced in that  aspect?


************Dudes from South America: do you associate Christmas with winter? Edit to clarify: I'm perfectly aware that, in South America, summer comes from December to March. The reason behind my question  is that in American and European media, they portrait Christmas scenes in winter. Same for Mexico, where I'm from, but that makes sense. I was curious to see if multinationals do change their media to fit the reality in the southern hemisphere, or if they just leave it like it is.


************People who grew up poor, what's the most comically out-of-touch "advice" you've been given by someone wealthier? A lot of upper-middle class friends of mine at the University used to tell me to just save money and maybe I can have my own apartment and a car in my early twenties. 

Yeah, not sure how I was going to be able to do that with a part-time job in McDonalds on an hourly rate of $7.25 at that time.


************Chileans, you said "No"; now what? Where does that leaves Boric? What about the political forces that supported the new constitution? What is expected of them now? What about politics in general? Results up to this moment with 88% of the votes counted: https://www.servelelecciones.cl/#/votacion/elecciones_constitucion/global/19001


************What's the most fucked up city name of your country? Florianopolis, I know Florianopolis is a well sounding name but...The history behind it isn't beautiful.

Florianopolis is named after Floriano Peixoto, the 2nd president of Brazil who was born way far from the South, in Macei√≥.

He is extremely hated in Santa Catarina for the atrocities he commited regarding that state between 1893 and 1895 at Revolu√ß√£o Federalista, Floriano fought the Catarinense Federalists so fucking hard that he decided to kill everyone there who was at least considered a Federalist, which lead to a massacre/genocide at the Anhatomirim Island that killed 125 people in 1894, same year Desterro (city that was the capital of Santa Catarina) got renamed as Florianopolis.

I don't like the idea of changing the city's name but that's only because I'm already used to that name and I'd find weird if it suddenly changed, but I agree it is a bad name. Suggested names include Floripa (Florian√≥polis' nickname used by most of its people), Santa Sofia, Desterro (The city's old name), A√ßorianopolis, Ondina (Suggested name change before Desterro was renamed as Florianopolis) Ramosonopolis, etc.

But is there a city in your country that have a name with such a bad origin? Brazilians, is there other city here with a similar case?


************Excluding the one you natively speak, How would you rank Spanish, Portuguese, French, Italian and Romanian languages from the easiest to understand to the hardest? 


************Do you feel a close connection to fellow Latin Americans? I'm European. Europeans are very very different culturally, Ireland to Azerbaijan, Iceland to Malta there are various cultures and identities. However, Europeans still get along and feel a close connection.

Do Latin Americans get along with one another too? If a Mexican met a Chilean on holiday in Japan would you both be happy to see each other?

Another question. Would you be open to unification of your countries like the movement for European federalism, or does such a proposal seem like madness?


************Was this part of your childhood? Someone posted [this picture](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/2a/2f/e4/2a2fe4a940eca7959d1a1809ba79f307.jpg) as an example of something that is "part of every Latin American's childhood". Personally, I have no idea what they are talking about and I haven't seen that in my life. What is it? Where is this common? Was this part of your childhood?


************Why was "Avenida Brazil" such a phenomenon? By the time this telenovela came up (2012)  I wasnt even living in Latin America anymore but somehow I've heard of it. 
Not that I care about telenovelas anymore  but I keep hearing from this one .   they're even showing a re - run of it on a national  channel in Paraguay after all these.years . 
I watched it  a little bit  but i don't find it particularly "special" nor particularly "interesting " .  There were sooo many better Brazilian telenovelas with greater stories . Was it just good marketing?.

This telenovela is in the Guinness world records for being the most televised telenovela in the world or something


************Announcement: Cultural Exchange with /r/Italy scheduled for February 18th Hello,

We‚Äôd like to announce that we are having a Cultural Exchange with /r/Italy on the 18th of Feb, next Thursday. It is set at 2PM (14h) Rome time. Click [here](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html?iso=20210218T130000&p1=215&p2=45&p3=155&p4=51&p5=41&p6=232&p7=99&p8=124&p9=131&p10=190&p11=163) to convert it to your time zone.

**How does it work?** A stickied thread will be created on this sub for the Italians to ask us questions. Similarly, a thread will be created on r/Italy for us to ask questions to them.

For those unfamiliar with the concept of CEs, we have hosted multiple ones before. There should be a tag "Cultural Exchange" to search back to.

We had a good exchange with /r/Lebanon! Let's keep it up folks!


************How is Latin American friendliness compared to US American friendliness? Hola! I'm a Canadian from Ontario who have spent a lot of time in the US before pandemic.

From my personal experiences in the US. Americans generally wear a veneer of being very friendly. Like Canadians say they are sorry for everything, Americans want you to have a nice day and usually ask you "How are you?" question, but if you go a little deeper and you would find it is mostly fake and superficial. I found out that to making "real" friends with Americans is harder than in Canada. I‚Äôve also heard this more than once from British and German friends who lived in the US: ‚ÄúYou guys smile all the time, even when you‚Äôre not happy with what‚Äôs going on. What‚Äôs with that?‚Äù

I haven't had the opportunity to visit Latin American countries yet due to Coronavirus at this time, but I heard that people are also really friendly and talkative like US American people?? Gracias!


************Why are Brazilians in this subreddit instantly switching to portuguese when speaking to other Brazilians? Por que voc√™s fazem isso seus fdp do carai?


************LGBT people of this sub, have you come out to your friends/family? How did it go? My own experience has overall been okay, my friends are cool but only half of my family knows I'm bi, and one halve of that half had a really mediocre reaction

UPDATE: I'd like to answer every comment but there are so many at this point. I just want to wish everyone who's going through a though situation strength, and that things do get better with time, they always do. Sending love ‚ù§Ô∏è


************How do you feel about non Latin American people on the internet promoting sex tourism in Latin America? Like the case of [Cuba Dave](https://ticotimes.net/2016/11/16/cuba-dave-verdict) or the multitude of [YouTube channels promoting DR](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIF8k7cAEo).


************Argentinian girls told us to wear an extra pair of pants at the club. Were they fucking with us? Ignorant foreigner with ignorant question.

So we were at a high school exchange a couple of months ago to Bahia Blanca from Copenhagen. We wanted to go out to a club and the local girls told us that girls should wear an extra pair of pants so we wouldn't get r\*ped.

Is it like a figure of speech or something or were they joking? They seemed dead serious about it but maybe they were just good actors. Or is it a real thing?


************Have you ever been mistaken for a different nationality? 


************If reggaeton ever stops being popular, What genres of music would you like to see replace it? 


************Vos or t√∫? The usage of voseo in Latin America Hi! I've been learning Spanish for almost a year now and I've got the basics covered. I guess you could say that I'm conversational, heading towards fluent.
I'm pretty good when it comes to understanding Mexican Spanish and Spanish from Spain, but other accents/varieties leave me confused.

I'm familiar with voseo and it's conjugation. I know that in certain countries it's used almost exclusively instead of t√∫, but I know that there are countries which use both and sometimes even one person could use both - hello, Colombia, Guatemala :).

The thing is - I know it exists, but sometimes when i listen to people and don't expect them to use it and they end up using it, my mind just doesn't pick it up lol. The sentence becomes just a blob of sounds without a meaning.

I'm very interested about the ways it is used in different cultures - if you use both, are they different in meaning? Are there situations where you would prefer using one over the other? Do you address only certain people with t√∫ or vos? Or is it totally interchangeable?

BTW, I'm prom Poland üáµüá± ;)


************Native rights in Brazil    
   
 Hi, my name is Tori and I'm an international relations student. I am doing research work on native rights in Brazil and I need to interview people with such a background. For some reason, every time I upload a post in Portuguese to Brazilian groups, the post is deleted ...


************Chileans who still support Pi√±era, Why? Sorry, I'm not Chilean, I have a friend who absolutely despises him, i wanna inform myself in all the opinions possible.


************Do Latin Americans have "move out of parents' house at 18/19" culture like Americans and Canadians?  In the US and Canada, I have always heard and found stories about parents generally forcing their kids to move out when they turn 18/19 or after finnish high school. Or sometimes, their parents let them to stay, but they still choose to move out instead because they don't want to be judged for being a "loser" by their peers. However, Americans and Canadians of East Asian and Southern Europeans (mostly Italians) descent seem to be the exception through.

But, what about Latin America? Do you guys also have this kind of culture? 


************How often do you shower? I‚Äôll shower every other day I‚Äôm very European by Panamanian standards when it comes to this. I rarely will spend time in heat unless I‚Äôve gone motor cycle riding or doing outdoor activities. 

In Panama though people shower 2/3 times a day because of how humid it is and most don‚Äôt spend 24 hours a day indoors or in ac.

Will wash my balls and shower after sex.


************Latinos who moved to European countries have people complimented you for speaking English, French, German, Dutch, Italian..etc? Hello everyone, 

I have some close Latino friends(mostly online). I wonder what your experience has been when moving to Europe and having to learn any of the European languages. For instance, say you moved to Germany and started working there. Did people tell you, "Oh, your German is great, where are you from?"


************What do people from your country think about Klingons/ The Klingon empire? 


************How Western is Latin America? Do Latin Americans identify more with Europe than say, Africa or Asia? From what I know of the continent it seems very Western to me, yet people view it as somewhere exotic since it's part of the 'third world'


************What is your take on the automatic birthright citizenship (jus soli) in Latin America? If I recall correctly, almost every country in LatAm grants citizenship at birth based mostly on *jus soli*, which means that anyone born in these countries would automatically become a citizen of that country. In most of Europe, Asia, Africa, and Oceania, citizenship is granted based on *jus sanguinis* (the ethnicity or nationality of the child's parents).

Recently I came to know that Colombia and the Dominican Republic are exceptions to the *jus soli* rules in LatAm.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but I read that at least one of your parents needs to be a Colombian citizen/a legal resident in order for you to become a Colombian citizen at birth. I also found that the Dominican Republic has changed some laws in order to 'end' automatic birthright citizenship a few years ago.

My question to all LatAm people out there is: **do you agree, disagree, or simply don't care for the application of the** ***jus soli*** **rules in your country?**

I would also like to hear from Colombian and Dominican people on this sub about their take on this matter regarding their countries.


************Why did so many Italians migrate to latin america and the new world in general? Like for the irish they had a famine, the spanish went to mine gold and settle in their colonies ect but why did so many Italians move to the new world? Is their a particular reason and what impacts did the Italians have on your culture or economy? Thanks have a good day


************Spanish speakers, is it easy to tell if a Latino/Hispanic person grew up in the USA just based on their spanish? I wasn't sure how to properly word the question. But is there a lack of accent or different words used that shows that they are from the USA when they are speaking spanish?

Of course this will vary from person to person.


************If LatinAmerica was a family, what kind of relative would each country be? For me, Brazil would be the distant uncle that you seldom visit but each time you see him you have a good time. He might also drink a little too much sometimes.

Uruguay and Argentina would be twin brothers, everybody would have thought Argentina to accomplish better things in life but he ended up dropping out of college and fucking up his life, while Uruguay, against all expectations, ended up pretty good (he is also a stoner).

Chile is the individualist cousin that has had a lot of fights with other relatives but lives like a king in his own apartment away from all the others. But they all still love him though.

What do you think?


************What countries in Latin America would you say have the strongest African influence and which have the strongest Indigenous influence? 


************How would a collapse of the USA affect Latin American countries? Theoretically if for some reason the United States would split up or become a minor power. Would countries like Brazil or Argentina become superpowers? Or would the situation change in Latin America insignificantly?


************Latin Americans, what is your opinion on Spaniards? 


************Guys, they might know something [https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAnAmerican/comments/9k0g3p/what\_do\_you\_know\_about\_paraguay/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAnAmerican/comments/9k0g3p/what_do_you_know_about_paraguay/)

They might find out the truth, we can't let them know it's real, what should we do? Start a misinformation campaign? "Paraguay, the big crater in the middle of South America", or what?


************Latin Americans who have been abroad, what have you been mistaken for? For instance, Mexicans, depending on their physical appearance, can be mistaken for a multitude of things: Middle Easterner, East Asian, South Asian, Southern European, etc.


************Are cashiers allowed to sit down in your country? It blew my mind learning that in the states in most supermarkets they don‚Äôt give them chairs! Wtf gringos!?! In Peru of course they have chairs.


************TIL that Latin America is more urbanized than Europe and Asia. Why do you think that despite this the image of Latin Americans being mostly rural or living in rainforests persists in global media? [Source](https://i.redd.it/uokfvk2gopt81.png)

Hopefully this doesn't count as agenda pushing lol


************Why Argentinians are stereotyped having big noses by other Latin Americans? 


************What's a cultural thing that Latin America and North America both share? 


************Thoughts on American Senator Ted Cruz straight up threatening democratic Latin American governments that "choose socialism"? [https://twitter.com/KawsachunNews/status/1557233915655585792](https://twitter.com/KawsachunNews/status/1557233915655585792)

************People who don't eat rice every day, what do you eat? 


************Are we living the time with most populists ruling latin america ever? &#x200B;

* Lopez Obrador in Mexico
* Nayib Bukele in El Salvador
* Daniel Ortega in Nicaragua
* Diaz Canel in Cuba
* Nicolas Maduro in Venezuela
* Pedro Castillo in Peru
* Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil
* Alberto Fernandez in Argentina


************Is the "Sacadme de latinoam√©rica" based on something? Is there something going on in your country that makes you want to leave? If so, what is it? 


************Does the rest of latin America hit pi√±atas at kids parties? Dont know if this has been asked before, but did you guys also have pi√±atas at kids parties? And if so do you sing a song while someone is hitting it? I know in the US some Americans do it


************Argentinians/Paraguayans/Bolivians, why is it so easy to enroll in your universities? It has become quite trendy around here for people who postulate for a Med School degree to go to Argentina for their education. 

The reason for this is how lobbying around here made it almost impossible for the average joe to enroll in Med School. In the federal unis, one has to compete between usually 80-150 people for just one place. And in the shittiest of private unis, you fight against 30-40 people, and pay, low-guessing, close to R$ 4000 (64764,56 pesos) per month, plus living expenses if you are not a son of the Bourgeois and do not live in the town.


************Who are the best and worst presidents in Latin America right now? Why? I understand that people often support people according to their own political alignment, but I'd like to see which presidents you think are good leaders in general. (However, it's totally fine if your decision is based on political agreement!)

Regardless of political affiliation, I think we all can agree that a good president represents the country well and creates policy that improves the quality of life of the citizens of that country. I love learning about Latin America, so thanks for any insight you can provide! Saludos desde California, EEUU.


************How do Latin Americans view Guyana , French Guiana and Suriname ? Does anyone ever go visit these countries ? They seem to be sort of forgotten about on the map  .  Do you know anyone from there ?


************Are Spanish speaking Latin Americans bad seen when they immigrate to Spain? I wonder this as Portuguese people don‚Äôt really like Brazilian people going to Portugal.

There is this r/ portugueses here on Reddit where there are countless posts complaining about how they go to shops, restaurants etc and there are Brazilians working there, Brazilians waking in the street, Brazilian music in these places etc etc etc. They claim all Brazilian women are prostitutes, we are all dumb etc etc.

I don‚Äôt want to generalize tho as I don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs a majority that dislikes this influx of Brazilian people in the country.

I also do try to put myself in their shoes as the Brazilian population is 20x bigger than the Portuguese so the few Brazilians that move to Portugal make a large portion of their immigration. Specially given the language similarity etc. To make the situation even worse portuguese kids are now speaking Brazilian lingo as a large proportion of their YouTube content is Brazilian.

Brazilians are really ‚Äúconquering Portugal back‚Äù, I think it‚Äôs funny but I‚Äôd be pissed if I was portuguese.

So given the similar spectrum, do people from Latin America suffer the same ‚Äúhate‚Äù towards them in Spain?


************Have you seen any recent news about the Yanomami people starving and dying in Northern Brazil? For reference: [Reuters news article from a day ago](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/brazil-declares-emergency-over-deaths-yanomami-children-malnutrition-2023-01-22/)


************Brazilians, is there anything you WOULDN‚ÄôT put on pizza? 


************Easter question to Spanish speaking countries. Do children in your country say cuascuas instead of Pascuas or is that just a thing in Argentina? Here kids often say cuascuas and grownups say it as a joke, but honestly I never know if children really have a hard time with the word or if we‚Äôve made it a thing. 

Anyway, Felices Cuascuas to those that celebrate and happy Sunday to the rest!


************What was the worst natural disaster in your country? 


************Where should we draw the line between bring critical of your own country and viralatismo/malinchismo/complejo de inferioridad? I think being critical is OK. We cannot be blind and ignore all the problems our region has. However, where should we draw the line between criticizing your country/region and *viralatismo*? I don't know if that's something we see mostly on social media (especially Twitter) where everything is negative all the time.


************which company that exists almost everywhere in the world that is not in your country? Or you have a weak presence.


************Do you consider Guinea Ecuatorial as culturally Hispanic? I follow some Youtubers from Guinea Ecuatorial, and and it's impressive how relatable they are.

Despite how far away they are from us, [they genuinely act (and speak) like any other Latino](https://youtu.be/IFz1TVOSdP0)

I kinda feel they should be considered Honorary LatinAmericans ü§î What do you  think?


************Why don't we in Hispanic America use vosotros? The other day I was thinking about how annoying it is that *ustedes* and *ellos* share the same conjugations, and sometimes is necessary to specify to the addressee what pronoun you are using, alongside with other pet peeves of mine regarding the generalised usage of this pronoun, while *vosotros* literally has everything that is needed for a complete plural second person pronoun with no complications.

I know that it's taken rather mockingly (for example if someone wants to create an archaic-like speech, or to mock the Spaniards) but it's certainly quite functional. Why is it that we don't use it here in LA? 

How would you feel using this pronoun?


************is it only me or almost all latin americans cities are built immediately next to a super big mountain like almost every city of latam i have visited are built immediately next to a mountain:
caracas, bogot√°, CDMX, monterrey, cali, valencia de venezuela, sao paulo‚Ä¶

it is definitely not something bad but its a very funny correlation ahahahs


************Since Spain has so far obliterated Costa Rica (currently 7-0), which team will Costa Ricans (and others who rooted for CR) of this sub be rooting for now? 


************Let's turn the tables. LATAM, what do you want to be asked? 


************Why is there so much difference between Mexico and the rest of Latin amaerica in terms of international visitors? Leading destination countries in Latin America and the Caribbean in 2019

1. Mexico	 -45.02 M
2. Argentina -7.4 M
3. Dominican Republic -6.45 M
4. Brazil	-6.35 M ???
5. Chile	-4.52 M
6. Peru	-4.37 M
7. Cuba	-4.26 M 
8. Colombia	-4.15 M
9. Puerto Rico -3.18 M
10. Costa Rica 	-3.14 M
11. Uruguay 	-3.06 M


************Earthquake Hey everyone, A big earthqauke just hit Lima and surrounding area, it lasted for like 15 seconds and sounded like a freight train. Did anyone else in Peru, Chile or Ecuador feel it ? And is everyone okay ?


************On a scale of 1-10 how much African influence is there on your country‚Äôs culture? I saw a similar question asked a while back about the indigenous influence so I‚Äôm curious. I‚Äôm of Puerto Rican descent so I have an idea when it comes to the Spanish Caribbean but I‚Äôd still like to hear the responses.

Edit: also I should mention. I don‚Äôt mean African influence compared to the other influences in your country. I meant compared to other Latin American countries. You could say 7 but that doesn‚Äôt mean there‚Äôs more African than Spanish influence if that makes sense..


************What stereotypes did you believe about other Latin countries that you no longer believe in? Some I used to belive:

* I believed there was a certain "Hispanic brotherhood" among Spanish-speaking Latinos (And I realized that, in general, many hate each other).
* I believed Chileans were more proud of their indigenous ancestry
* I thought I might suffer some hate in Argentina (it was the opposite, they treated me very well)
- I believed that all South american looked like a bolivian (with the excepcion of  brazil, argentina and uruguay)


************Why are Uruguay and Argentina so liberal? It is often said that Latam is very "conservative", "catholic", etc.. but Arg/Urug tend to be different in that regard, they allow abortion, were 2 of the first countries in the world to legalize lgbt marriage and they are very secular/atheist/ non-religious in comparison to the rest, Uruguay even allows the consuption of weed...why is that?

In other words, why are Uruguay and Argentina so liberal in comparison to the rest of the region?


************What's the most forgotten country in LATAM? In my opinion it may be Nicaragua or Paraguay, nobody cares about either sadly, specially considering how beautiful Nicaragua is. (I've never went to Paraguay so no idea about it, but the whole guarani stuff seems really interesting)


************Chileans, how do you feel about the shape of your country? I'm dead serious by the way.


************How is the coronavirus situation in Brazil right now? What could‚Äôve Bolsonaro done to ameliorate the situation?


************People who are dating (or have dated) another LATAM nationality: What new words or phrases were the weirdest or most amusing for you to learn? Did it make communicating hard? So I was watching [this](https://youtu.be/XJh0IvFWj74) video of a couple discussing different words from their culture. The girl is Boricua and the dude is Colombian and they talk about some fun problems they've had understanding each other's words for things like Cancha vs. Campo. ü§£

What has been your experience?


************Announcement: Cultural Exchange with /r/Ireland TOMORROW, March 26th. Hello,

We‚Äôd like to announce that we are having a Cultural Exchange with /r/Ireland on the 26th of March, tomorrow. It is set at 3PM (15h) Dublin time.

Amazing exchange we held with /r/NordicCountries!


************There is a pokemon tournament and each latinamerican country sends a champion, BUT, the pokemon team has to be centered in one type (dual type pkmn allowed) that represents your country mythology and culture. Wich pokemon team is fighting for your country? Optional: How humorously stereotypical would your champion be? (example: Chilean champion talks almost exclusively with swearing and has ground type pokemon (eartquakes))


************Does anyone else experience ‚Äúlanguage fatigue‚Äù after speaking in a different language throughout the day? I have a fairly good level in English and can partake in conversations with ease all day. However, when night comes I just want to speak Spanish (my native language) and feel exhausted from having spoken in English so much that day. I acknowledged this feeling when I was in the UK with a group of friends and had to constantly chat with locals, whether they were teachers or employees at shops with whom I couldn‚Äôt talk in Spanish to.


************Do you guys use the word "Ya" in your countries? Edit: So it looks like there is no other region that uses ‚ÄúYaaa‚Äù like they do in Bolivia (La Paz) such as in the examples below. But there are a few countries that do use ‚ÄúYa‚Äù as ‚Äúok, alright, go on‚Äù such as Peru, Chile and D.R sort of.

[Here is a video](https://youtu.be/sf2YUOCn7_w) where you see a group of Bolivians using ‚ÄúYaaa‚Äù multiple times.

I thought it was just a word we used in Bolivia until I found out some people in Peru and Chile use it as well.

\-"Ya" is like saying "Ok" or "alright".  It's used A LOT. (E.g -"Want to do something tonight?" - "Ya")

\-"Yaaa" is hard to explain and is also used a lot. It could be used for a lot of things lol. When someone makes an exaggerated statement, sarcastic joke or a joke that contains a statement of what they are going to do or what they did which would be pretty funny.  If the original person with the statement said something that the other person(s) don't believe what the original person said, then that original person or the friend/friends/crowd around them usually says/shouts "Yaaa".  It could also be used  by someone else, when someone does something unexpected but in a good show off way. I'm probably missing a lot of other scenerios and not explaining this all the way, so feel free to elaborate.

(E.g. Group of friends are camping during a hike and everyone has their own tent to sleep in. Girl says to guy ‚Äúyea it‚Äôs so cold I wish I could sleep next to this campfire all night.‚Äù Guy responds ‚ÄúYou know you can always come over to my tent so that we can both stay warm...yaaaa‚Äù and then chuckles. (Yaaa means he said something funny and he was joking, or was he?)

\-(E.g. Girl secretly like Guy 1 and ask him in front of Guy 2, what Guy 1's favorite food is. Guy 1 responds Lomo montado. Girls say "Me too!". Guy 2 laughs and says "Yaaa". Guy 2 doesnt beleive the girls statement that she likes that food and she prob only said that b/c she wants to be with Guy 1. Guy 2 saying "Yaa" makes it awkward for the girl, but funny for him and other friends that are around who would be teasing them.

\-(E.g. Large groups of people have been waiting outside a rock & roll night club late at night for over an hour drinking alcohol and waiting for people inside to get out as the club is'nt letting anyone in as it's at full capacity. -Drunk guy takes a shot with friends looks at his watch and notices it's 1:30 am. He shouts to everyone that is waiting outside too "¬°Ya chicos, continuaremos el farreo, doy casa....Yaaaa!" (Yaaa means he was joking around)

\-(E.g A group of young kids are betting that their slightly overweight friend can't do more then 30 pushups, Then the overweight kid starts doing pushups and not only passes 30 but gets to 50 and keeps on going. Kids surpisingly say "Yaaa".

\-(E.g Person 1 explaining to Person 2 how to use the word "Ya" in Bolivia.

Person 1: "You need to know when a Yaa is warrented and needed and when it is'nt. You need to execute the word at exactly the right scenerio and at exactly the right time. Misuing the word Yaa and miscalculating the timing of the word even by a second would be detrimental to the whole situation and..‚Äù

Person 2: \*interrupts\* ‚ÄúYaaa" while smiling.


************Are cashiers and bank tellers allowed to sit down in your country? In the USA, cashiers and bank tellers aren't allowed to sit while working. They're not given chairs. The business philosophy is that it makes workers "look lazy" and may turn off customers. If you sit, you can get fired.

Are cashiers and bank tellers allowed to sit down in your country?


************Do Latin Americans find people from other cultures to be cold? I've read that people in Latin America are very emotional and passionate. Do you think this is true? If so, do you find people from other places (say, Europe or America) to be "cold"?


************Redditors of r/asklatinamerica: Are you familiar with Argentinian cartoonist Quino's character Mafalda, her comic strips, books and animated series? For those who do not know, [Mafalda](https://p2.trrsf.com/image/fget/cf/1200/1200/filters:quality(85)/images.terra.com/2014/03/14/mafalda-desenho-quino-619x4.jpg) is an Argentinian comic character drawn by also Argentinian cartoonist Joaqu√≠n Salvador Lavado Tej√≥n, better known as Quino. Mafalda is a 6-year-old girl who Quino used to express concerns of his about the world and the youth. Mafalda became popular for expressing comically innocent but serious and very valid arguments regarding themes such as climate change, world peace, etc. The comic strips and books derived from them ran from 1964 to 1973, gaining recognition and praise in countries in Latin America, Europe and Asia. Its success led to two animated cartoon series even.

Alongside with Maur√≠cio de Souza's [Turma da M√¥nica](https://i0.wp.com/www.jadeseba.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Mauricio-de-Sousa-037.jpg?fit=1631%2C1061&ssl=1), in Brazil, Mafalda's comic strips are used across the board by middle and high school literature teachers, has been added a few times to different editions of the national higher education entrance examination ENEM, sometimes being used by professors in universities as well and so on.

I am a fan myself, owning a collection of Mafalda's [books](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71962FIOShL.jpg) and have yet to meet someone who has never heard of or been tested with one of Mafalda's strips here in school here Brazil. 

Are you at all familiar with Quino's character Mafalda? Is Quino's comic art and literary work known in your country? How widespread and used in the national educational system is it, if it is?


************Future Cultural Exchange with r/bangladesh! [Our friends over r/bangladesh](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangladesh/comments/ztlpo1/proposed_cultural_exchange_ce_with/) are proposing a cultural exchange with us. As you may know, that country is known for cheering for South American countries on football, and we thought that the recent wins by Argentina in the World Cup to encourage even more participation, even during the holidays.

For the uninitiated, users from r/asklatinamerica, representing various LATAM countries, will ask over a specific post over r/bangladesh (NOT YET!). **On our subreddit, the people of r/bangladesh will come to ask us questions**, discuss, and learn more about our culture and our customs. 

Needless to say, you're expected to respect everyone, the rules of our subreddit and also the rules of their subreddit.

---

# **We'd like to ask if you have any time and date that you prefer to start this exchange**.

If there are no suggestions here, we'll see which time works better for them. I should mention that our friends are 9 hours ahead of us.


************What does the average stereotype guy look like in your country? [Context](https://img.ifunny.co/images/e5617fafd4f3ae1bbd676711d77c06c79c02a91c46565f38424571a0de06ee2a_1.jpg)


************How much do you think US Latinos differ from Latin Americans culturally? 


************Which 5 countries are the most similar to yours according to the Country Similarity Index? (Google it!) Do you agree with the list? And which are the least similar according to the CSI?


************What is the most condescending thing someone's said to you? 


************What's something that your country is doing right? 


************What is the most viewed/popular movie from your country? And whats your favorite one (s)? Personally i think the most viewed/popular movie from Brazil is City of God (Cidade de Deus), and my favorite brazilian movie is A Dog's Will (O Auto da Compadecida)


************What's a wholesome or fun fact about your country Saw this on ask Europe and I'm curious about it.


************Brasilians - condoms in Brasil? Condoms in Brasil - is my husband lying to me?

My husband came back from a trip in Rio de Janeiro, with 4 Manix Skyn condoms in his bag - supposedly bought them for us on his way back to the airport.
Only question is: in Europe, they are not sold without a box, or by 4, or if they were sold individually, they wouldn't still be attached to one another.
Anyone can enlighten me? Is it really how they are sold in Rio? üòÖ

UPDATE: Thanks all for your answers, and dedication to finding it. Don't know what I'll do with the info now, but at least I know i'm not going crazy


************Why do Argentina and Uruguay seem so underpopulated? Go to https://www.thetruesize.com. You can fit almost 2 Spains in just the northeast of Argentina. Yet Spain has 48 million people while Argentina has 47 million despite having much more flat and arable land. 

Uruguay is as big as England+Wales (60 mil) or 2 Irelands (7 mil) but only has 3 million which seems super low. Only 20 people per km2. 

 This region in SA seems like it has a ton of potential to support millions of more people considering the geography and climate.

Is it because the soil is not that good or not enough water? Low immigration from elsewhere?


************Israel or Palestine? Who do u support? So a few weeks ago there was tension between Chile and Israel, after the ambassador of Israel was not received by the president after some events that had happened in the Israel-Palestine border.

So the question‚Ä¶ which side do u support? Arguments? And please let‚Äôs keep it civilized:) 
Also what‚Äôs your countries posture towards the issue.


************Do older generations in your country mock or shame younger people for working non-manual jobs? e.g. They think being a plumber or foreman is a "real job" but web design or music production isn't. 


************Why is South America so much more progressive on LGBT rights than the Caribbean? Gay marriage is legal in most of South America, and countries like Uruguay and Argentina seem to be very progressive on the matter, but when looking at most of the Caribbean, like Jamaica, Barbados, and Dominican Republic, gay rights seem to be very far behind. Even when looking at Central America, how come Costa Rica is so much more progressive than say, Honduras or Nicaragua, when it comes to LGBT. I know it likely has to do with differences in religiosity, but Brazil, (where gay marriage is legal) and Bolivia, (where gay marriage isn't allowed) both have similar levels of irreligious people, and that likely goes for other countries as well.


************Which nationality to you is a "unicorn"? By unicorn I mean a nationality that everyone seems to always talk about and claim to have met but you personally have never seen one in person because they're so rare in your area. 

My unicorns are Venezuelans and Colombians. Lol From outside the region, it's Canadians.


************How do you feel about atheists? Recently, I told a (non-atheist) friend of mine that I was an atheist and he jokingly responded "well, now I think you're an asshole!". Even though he was sort of joking I still feel like he was expressing a little bit of his feelings there... Now I wonder what the people on this sub feel about atheists, especially non-atheists


************What is the most culturally significant piece of media of your country? 


************Today, Astor Piazzolla would've been 100 years old. What do you think of his work? I'm a huge fan of Piazzolla -- he is for sure my favourite composer -- and I wonder what you good people think of his work.


************What do you think of the middle east? Hello, I'm an Arab from Iraq and I just want to know what you think of the middle east in general.


************How bad is terrorism in your country? Hi, don't worry I'm not one of those crazy people who thinks that you will be blown up by the Taliban as soon as you enter Latin America. Sirously like how much of a threat are terrorist organisations in latin America like FARC ect? Has the situation gotten better or worse over time? What kinds of people do they target? How do terrorists get power in your country?

Also: i feel like this is important to add because there is a lot of misconceptions surrounding the definition of terrorists. They don't have to be Islamic ( i doubt the terrorists in latin America will be Islamic) they can have any political motivation for example the Buddhist fanatics in Burma who are committing war crimes against the Rohingyan minority. They are non Muslim terrorists.

Anyway have a great day.


************If Latin America had an anthem, which song should it be? 


************What is a question you'd like to make here but are to affraid to make a thread about?? Maybe asking in the comments doesn't seem too intimidating.

EDIT: "too affraid"


************Do you identify yourself as Latino? So hear me out. I‚Äôm Chilean and I‚Äôve lived my whole life in Chile, and I had never considered myself Latino, just Chilean. This year however I did a youth exchange in Germany and seeing as most Germans were cold as fuck my support group was mostly other Latin Americans, and now I strongly consider myself Latin American-still Chilean first, but I do consider part of my identity to be Latin American.

I know this sub always says there‚Äôs no united Latino culture, but how many of you have lived for a prolonged amount of time with other latinos from different countries ?

Edit:As several people have mentioned, I probably should have used Latin American instead of Latino


************What do you think of a non-latinamerican celebrating a Quince or 15 party? Recently saw a tiktok about an Indian girl that said she wanted to have a quincea√±era because she likes the party+fluffy dress+etc

Link to the tiktok: https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMF35PQ9W/

The no sabo americans were going feral but I honestly don't get the gatekeeping, if it were up to me anyone can try and throw their 15s party.

What do you all think?


************Latin america and heritage Often here on reddit when  I talk to people from the US they will claim an ancestry not from the US. They'll say they're Irish or Polish or Italian, but they don't speak the Language, and have never been to the country.

In Latam, this very rarely happens, even though their countries are almost as old as the US. To give just one example, people from the Dominican Republic are extremely certain they're Dominicans. Where does this difference come from?


************Why do so many Hispanics and Latinos have two last names? Why do so many Hispanics and Latinos have 2 last names? How does this work?


************What is your top 3 of the most beautiful flags in Latin America? The mine is this:

1) Brazil üáßüá∑

2) Dominican Republic üá©üá¥

3) Panama üáµüá¶

In this order


************What's the creepiest fact about your country? 


************Brasilians, what is the best way to communicate with you if not by Portuguese? I heard that brasilians don't like if you talk to them in Spanish. Is it better in English? Is it possible to get by on English with locals?


************I have some questions for this sub (possibly controversial). 1. Do you believe that the foods, traditions and customs of your country were created by the lower classes (poor?) or the elites of society?

2. Do you believe that the elites of your country have more in common with the elites of other LATAM countries and the USA / Canada than the lower class of the country?

3. Do you think that your elites actually like to eat the traditional foods of your country?

  If not what do you think they actually eat?

4. Do they speak with a different accent compared to the lower classes?

5. This question is for those who are not from LATAM:

  When you think of a LATAM country's foods, customs and traditions, do you automatically imagine the lower class population or the elites?


************Mexico's center-right party, Partido Acci√≥n Nacional (PAN), has formed and alliance with the Spanish far-right party VOX. Have political parties from your countries ever formed allegiances with parties or groups from other countries? To avoid "pushing and agenda", I won't say how I personally feel about this.


************How is dating someone with big age difference viewed in your country? There's the popular divide by 2, + 7 rule.

So of you're 34, you divide it by 2 and add 7, so the youngest you should date is 24.

But growing up, it always felt like girls preferred older men in general. In high school 16-18 bragged about being able to have sex with a 22-25 year old guys because it made them "cool" and the older guys had cars, driver's license, etc.

What's it like in your country?


************What is something about Latin America that you are grateful for which doesn't exist or isn't common elsewhere? Our nature is breathtaking but saying "We have this specific natural wonder" is still a cop-out answer.


************Bolivians, which places a traveler should visit? If I get the opportunity, once the pandemic ends I want to make a bus trip all the way to the Brazilian-Bolivian border, and so I'm looking for places close to it to visit.


************How do people in your country view the Japanese? I'm from the US but reside in Japan. When I was traveling around South America I noticed that there was a wide difference among people in terms of how they see the Japanese. I remember several conversations when I told people I lived in Japan they replied with "oh, I don't really like the Chinese." But then. in Sao Paulo for example they have a big presence and people have an overall positive image and have some knowledge. How about in your country?


************What does latino or latin american mean for you? Lets agree on what it means, so we dont go into irrational discussions about its definition


************Does your country on average treat your nationality more as an ethnicity or a citizenship? So all of our countries are pretty much multiethnic. But in your country would people identify more with their nationality as an ethnicity or their ancestral ethnicity. Like for example if you have a 4th generation Italian Argentinian or Argentinian of most Italian descent would they identify more as just an Argentinian or an Argentinian of Italian descent? What about for Mestizos?


************Which are the Latin American countries that you're surprised to see few users from on this subreddit? In my case it is Peru and Mexico. They have kind of large populations, but we don't see a lot of users from those countries. We see more people from Puerto Rico, Chile and Costa Rica.


************How popular was "ai se eu te pego" in your country? You guys know the song from Michel Telo right?


************The behavior of the people of what Latinamerican country has surprised you the most? I'm Peruvian and in my country they always say that Chilean people are very rude (specially towards us), that they discriminate us and so on. So when I was going to go to Santiago (I lived there for almost a year) I was scared that I was going to be mistreated... At the end it surprised me how kind they were to me as a foreigner and specially as a Peruvian: they always said our food and culture was incredible and always tried to help me when I needed it.


************Candidates for the award "Grigo Post of the year 2024" As we are starting the year i belive could be a good idea to collect the mos "gringo" post of the year so we all can laught together in december. 

Feel free to add the post so they don't get lost in the achives of the sub. 


************What are some cultural traits and characteristics that your American diaspora counterparts don‚Äôt realize are very ‚ÄúAmerican‚Äù? I‚Äôm an US born-and-raised child of parents who came from Mexico and it‚Äôs very common for other people from backgrounds like mine to be very openly flaunting their ‚ÄúMexican-ness‚Äù, I‚Äôd say in large part due to an anti-American attitude that‚Äôs common even in the US, but I can‚Äôt help but get the feeling that they still seem to be very‚Ä¶ American. 

The only obvious thing I can think of is having broken Spanish but besides that, I can‚Äôt really pinpoint anything. Maybe I can‚Äôt point the out reasons because I‚Äôm American myself but I‚Äôm curious and I‚Äôm not even sure if this is a thing with other diaspora from other Latin American countries but I‚Äôd like to know that as well.

What would you guys say? What are some ways people American-borns who identify with their parents‚Äô homeland don‚Äôt realize they‚Äôre noticeably American?


************USA citizens visiting Brazil...I have some questions! Hi everyone - my girlfriend and I are visiting Praia Grande, Santos, and Sao Paulo, Brazil. We are from Ohio, in the US. We have never been to Brazil before, and we are not sure what to expect. 

Do you have any recommendations of things to watch out for, things to do, places or things to avoid, etc? 

Thanks in advance for your help üòÄ 

Edit: we had a great time in Brazil! No issues whatsoever. My favorite part was surfing in guaruj√° - the beach there is great. I also loved the food and drink service on the beach - not something you usually see in the US. I learned some basic Portuguese, and was able to handle all my transactions. Brazilians are very friendly and patient with people who don't speak Portuguese well. Also, caipirinhas are delicious!


************What silly rules would you put in place in r/asklatinamerica to make this place more fun or to f*ck with people‚Äôs head? I think that anyone who does not use a flag flair should automatically be assumed to be Mexican and treated as such‚Ä¶


************Is there a first name you hear that makes you think ‚Äúyeah, that person is from my country‚Äù? I‚Äôve known a few women named Genesis and they are all Venezuelan


************Which city in your country are you most ashamed of? Inspired by this European thread 

https://old.reddit.com/r/MapPorn/comments/px4992/which_city_embarrasses_you_the_most/


************How do people pronounce 'YouTube' in your country? A Catalan friend of mine once told me that in Spain, people pronounce it as yo-u-tu-be, as if the word is Spanish. Whereas in Hispanic America, people just pronounce it the English way with Spanish accent. 

Is this true? Also I'm curious about Brazil and other countries.


************Does your country‚Äôs subreddit have any ‚Äúfamous‚Äù users? In r/argentina we have u/lamantita , who asked for tips in order to visit a slum/favela/villa and then mysteriously dissapeared / stopped showing activity on his account, and no one knows what happened to him

Edit: Just to clarify, I mean someone famous within the subreddit, not someone that‚Äôs known by the whole country


************A bit of an innocent question, how is it to live in a big country? I've lived all my life in Panama, and I can't imagine how would it be to live in a big country. 

Don't you find it weird that going to some places in the country may take more than 24h by land? In Panama everything feels like "within reach", after driving 24 hours are you even in the same country anymore.

Isn't it weird that there are places in your country that you've never visited? Like entire provinces or states the size of my country? Or towns of a couple thousand people with names you've never heard?

I also find it weird that people take flights to go to other places INSIDE the country, I know it makes all the sense in the world, but in my country the only reason you would take a plane is to go to somewhere outside of the borders. 

How is it having multiple big cities? are they like similarly important or is one of them superior in some way? It's just weird thinking of a country having not one, but many "hearts".


************Is El Chavo del Ocho known everywhere in latinamerica? Hey guys! I have seen El Chavo since my childhood and I am only 20. My uncle is 35 and also grew with it. My mother is in her 50s and also grew with it. And my little cousin is 9 and is watching it in this very moment. How is it in your countries? Is it very known?


************I find the questions of this subreddit too weird The questions that we see everyday seems like something out of the Jetsons Meet the Flintstones movie.

Latinamerica isnt another planet, jezz.


************Buenos Aires has the most bookstores per capita in the world. What other cool records have been set in Latin America? Also if any Argentines could tell me their favorite bookstore, I‚Äôd love to check them out someday!

************41 One Years ago Argentine forces landed on the Falkland Islands marking the start of the Falklands War Argentinians of this sub, how is the war viewed today and does it still affect politics to this day?

Is there still an idea that the islands are argentine territory?


************How much racism is in Brazil? Is it common? How does it compare with USA, France and UK? Which parts of the country are the best? Thank you


************What do Latin Americans think about hijab events in Iran and how much the media there talk about it? 


************Chile just qualified to their first ever rugby world cup, how you feeling chileans? 


************YouTube has blocked all access to RT en Espa√±ol and derivates in LatAm. Thoughs? 


************How spicy is the food in your country? I'm Mexican and our food is in general quite spicy. I add chile (aka aj√≠ in South America) to basically every meal, from the eggs in the breakfast, to a sandwich, etc. This spicy culture is sometimes a source of "pride" amongst Mexicans but also Mexican-Americans (chicanos), the latter or which I've seen commonly obnoxiously joking about being "latino" with stuff like "us latinos can handle spicy food but boring lame white Americans can't üòÇ". I just laugh at the thought of that because I know it's a generalization and other countries in LATAM don't have spicy food, like Argentina or so.

So I wanna now, how spicy is the food in your country?

&#x200B;


************Is the Argentine accent evolved from the Italian accent? I just noticed the two accents sound identical and I want to wonder if there‚Äôs something behind this or it‚Äôs just a coincidence.


************Dear Salvadorans. Today bitcoin was adopted in El Salvador. What are your thoughts and experiences on it? There are reports of protests since its value dropped roughly 20%. Have you used it yet? what are your thoughts on it since its adoption? and what do you think of the protests?


************Why does Argentina have so many taxes? 


************When you order a burguer from local restaurants, do you have the option to fill it with peas? Do you also consider it to be a violation of the Geneva Convention? Kinda like the salad and corn that comes inside the bread.


************What do you think of Japan's obsession with capybaras https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUqCWkPlLLc

They put bunch of them in the cold and then put oranges on their head. I feel like capybara should not be in the cold like that


************Can you drink alcohol in the streets in your country? One of the craziest things about USA is not being able to just drink a can of beer in the street or havng to hide alcohol. Its basically 50% of our way of living in brazil


************I recently discovered a dialectal quiz for the Spanish language. It aims to tell you where you're from based on how you speak. It's 26 questions. Would you care to take it and comment on its accuracy? This is the test: https://www.dialectosdelespanol.org/quiz


************Crazy male attention as a black woman‚Ä¶ So, I‚Äôm currently at the end of my second month travelling through Latin America. I‚Äôve been to Mexico, Guatemala, Costa Rica and have just landed in Colombia and the male attention I have received has been actually insane. 

Mexico was a lot of staring. Constantly. Like, leaning out of cars and holding up traffic staring. Lots of cat calling as well. Guatemalans had a more friendly approach which was ok. Most encounters I had with men started super friendly and more often than not ended with them asking me out. These are the only men who have tried to go in for a kiss lol which had me shook. Costa Rica was funny. Just a lot of compliments. I have my hair in long braids and I got complemented on that a lot. I did two tours and got asked out by both of my tour guides (one is married so eww).  

Is this‚Ä¶a usual experience for a black tourist in Latin America? To be clear, I am not a model. I‚Äôm short, dark-skinned, slim. I rarely go outside dressed up. I don‚Äôt wear makeup and wear baggy clothes 99% of the time so it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm walking around looking irresistible lol. My (kinda) ex is Mexican and he told me I would get a lot of attention in Mexico but I don‚Äôt know, what is the general attitude towards black women across Latin America? Appreciation, fetishisation‚Ä¶looking for some understanding because I have literally never received so much constant male attention in my life. It‚Äôs an experience for sure. 

EDIT - for extra context, I‚Äôm short (5‚Äô3) and British. I‚Äôve only been visiting tourist hot spots. Oaxaca, Mexico City, Antigua, Panajachel, Tortuguero, San Jose. 


************How do argentines know us so well? Honestly, it‚Äôs incredible! I‚Äôm currently with my fianc√© in Buenos Aires and everyone knows we‚Äôre Brazilian! I‚Äôve been to places in Brazil (like S√£o Paulo and Bras√≠lia where people mistook us for foreigns - because of German descent) but somehow in Argentina they can always tell!


We were walking down the street this morning, not saying a word and a guys comes up and asks where from Brazil we came from. We weren‚Äôt even talking! 
I think it‚Äôs amazing! I have nothing but love for Argentina, they truly are our hermanos! ‚ù§Ô∏è

She already had her flight and hotel booked...

************Countries that don't eat either tortillas or arepas, it's time for you to chose a side. In this battle between Team Tortilla and Team Arepa  there can be only one winner.

Here I will make the case for both tortillas and arepas to make your choice easier:

**Tortillas** [Mx](https://ep01.epimg.net/elcomidista/imagenes/2017/07/18/receta/1500412616_659458_1500413386_media_normal.jpg), [Gt/Sv/Ni](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Zzy5-9Z0DD0/UTgfOa6Au1I/AAAAAAAABRM/3Y0Me22fvFM/s1600/20130222-DSC03652.jpg), [Hn](https://comidashondurenas.com/wp-content/uploads/tortillas-de-harina.jpg), [Cr](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/_4ijLJs20PWU/S60VYQx7OgI/AAAAAAAAEE8/0hBFYUvzKYA/s1600/tortilla+maizam+(3)

+ It's the most versatile of the two, it's soft texture means it can be used to grab and eat just about anything at just about any time. There's nothing like grabbing a piece of churrasco or chorizo straight out of the grill with a fresh tortilla, and enjoying it with a beer without having to ever sit down or leave the back yard

+ It can be used for a wider variety of dishes: [tacos](https://s23209.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Mexican-Street-TacosIMG_9108-1.jpg), enchiladas (both the [Mexican](https://1bqu1qjqw3y3g50yf4cszxnd-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/enchiladas-verdes-600x397.jpg) and the [Central](https://www.thefoodieskitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/guatemalan-enchiladas-thefoodieskitchen.jpg) [American](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/4d/2e/74/4d2e74ddd02abfcd0d38062f6caf29e6.jpg) variety), [pupusas](https://res.cloudinary.com/hksqkdlah/image/upload/SFS_papusas-173_vojda5.jpg), [baleadas](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8d/Baleada.jpg), and [mixtas](https://www.thefoodieskitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Mixtas01.jpg) among others

**Arepas** [Co](https://arepasdelgringo.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/arepas_with_cheese_recipe.jpg), [Vz](https://i.blogs.es/ba0268/arepas1/1366_2000.jpg), [Pn](https://donarepa.com.pa/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Receta-Tortilla.jpg) (they call it tortilla but in essence it's more like an arepa), [Ec](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-7B-qWFcxf5E/U-UF7l4BdcI/AAAAAAAADlI/Vv1M0M7HJN4/w1200-h630-p-k-no-nu/P8080245.JPG), [Bo](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ep7_Y-4u0h4/maxresdefault.jpg), [Pr](https://thenoshery.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/arepas-de-coco-720x720.jpg)

+ Usually more flavorful than tortillas, and more easily filled with cheese or butter for an overall better standalone experience.

+ Denser and more filling than tortillas

+ The Venezuelan variety is great as a replacement for bread in a sandwich, and can be filled with just about everything and anything you want for a great experience.

And no #teambread is not a feasible answer, we all eat bread.


************Does your country preserve archaic language from the Iberian Peninsula? It's said to be common that archaic language persists in the 'periphery' of a language sphere after it disappears from the 'center.'  Here in the U.S., you can occasionally hear vestiges of 17th century English in 'backwoods' areas.  For instance, the word "yonder," meaning "over there," which was common in Shakespeare's day.

I guess the 2nd person singular "vos" could be one easy answer?


************What is a food from your country you cannot stand? Or simply avoid? I‚Äôm Peruvian but I really avoid eating choclo, the type of corn we eat over here. Fellow Peruvians are weirded out when they hear me say that. What about you guys? Any snacks, dishes, or ingredients you don‚Äôt like or avoid eating altogether?


************Medellin mayor Federico Guti√©rrez announces the six-month suspension of sex tourism after US citizen found with two little girls at a hotel. Thoughts? https://english.elpais.com/international/2024-04-02/medellin-declares-war-on-sex-tourism-after-us-citizen-found-with-two-little-girls-at-a-hotel.html


************How are white Latinos treated in different places? I‚Äôm 100% Mexican and I‚Äôm very light skinned so I just consider myself to be white despite having indigenous ancestry. I‚Äôm the lightest person in my family in both the United States and Mexico. I‚Äôve noticed when I‚Äôm in Mexico I get treated extremely well whereas in the US I‚Äôm ostracized and even bullied by other Mexicans. In Mexico I‚Äôm nothing but beautiful but in the US I get called things like pasty and I get told that I‚Äôm not actually Mexican because of the way I look. How does it vary in different places? I‚Äôm curious as to how other white Latinos get treated because I don‚Äôt really encounter them very often.


************Why is Latin America so violent? People always say that its because poverty and corruption, but there are poor countries like Nepal  (that is in fact poorer than many Latin American countries) without such high murder rates.


************Why do we always joke about how Paraguay doesn't exist when the three Guianas are right there? Basically the title.

The joke is that Paraguay doesn't exist, but at least when there's some map showing statistics about Latam or Southamerica they're included and the data needed is available, whereas it seems like rarely there's any info provided from any of the three Guianas (though when one shows up it tends to be Surinam).

If it wasn't for that one surinamese user called Sheldon who did that AMA we probably wouldn't know anything about Surinam or really get any interaction in this sub with someone from a Guiana.

So yeah, whoever can find Paraguay should tell them to come out of hiding since we're switching and it's the Guianas' turn to hide now


************What do you think are the stereotypes of users on this subreddit per country Let me start with an example
 - üá∫üáæ Doesn't think Cisplatina jokes are funny 
 - üá®üá∫ Hates the government
 - üá¶üá∑ Hermanos
 - üá∫üá∏ Surprisingly wholesome people


************Is there anything nice you want to say today about other latino country/population? There's just so much hate out there, let's say something positive to our brothers, our about them. 

What do you appreciate about certain location or country in Latin America? what place you want to visit? what exchange with that nationality changed your life in any form?

have a great week, everyone!


************Are there any countries here who are actually doing well? 


************What were some misconceptions you had as a kid about Latin America? For example, I thought the Brazilian flag said "Order in Progress" (orden en progreso)


************How common is to use descriptive nicknames in your country? Like Gorda, Flaca, Rubio, Moreno, Negro, Chino. 


************How common are burritos in your country? Have you ever eaten one? I know they're common in northern Mexico, but I don't know about the rest of the country or in Latin America generally.


************¬øQui√©n es la mujer m√°s hermosa de Am√©rica Latina y por qu√© es Paquita La del Barrio? 


************What's an unique linguistic characteristic of your accent/dialect? For example:

* Rioplatenses pronouncing the 'y/ll' as a 'sh'
* Paisas saying 'pues' after almost any verb and as a filler word and pronouncing the 's' as a 'sh'
* Chilean voseo being more similar to reverential voseo from Spain and omitting the last 's' (like saying 'cach√°i' instead of 'cach√°s' or saying 'vai' like 'vais')
* Caribbeans using the personal pronoun like in English (¬øc√≥mo t√∫ te llamas?) and pronouncing the 's' as a 'j'

I'm not talking about unique words of slangs like Mexicans saying 'wey', but some linguistic quirks you can use to identify someone from a place easier.


************If you had to live in another Latin American country which would it be and why? 


************What do you think of the phrase 'I Don't See Color'? Something that's come up online with the recent BLM movement is that a lot of people supporting it from Latin America will inevitably say something like "I don't see race" or "I don't see color" and inevitably, someone from the United States will try to correct them.

I feel like this comes down to a fundamental difference in how Latin Americans see race vs how Americans see race. To a lot of Latin Americans, the end of racial differences feels like an ultimate ideal, in which it doesn't matter what color you are, you can become friends or have a relationship with any person, access any job or place, and live a normal, happy life. To a lot of Americans -from what I can see- the ultimate ideal is a world in which each others' racial differences and cultures are respected, but this culture remains very much alive in the hands of the people who created it. For this reason a phrase like 'I don't see color' has very different reactions between Latin Americans and Americans, leading to some unfortunate interactions online.

I hope I'm not coming across as biased here, and I'd be happy to be corrected on my view.

I'm mostly curious about the opinion of Latin Americans of African descent in this topic, because they may not be a majority in many countries and may identify more with the second view, but anyone else is free to give their opinion. A secondary question would be: how do you feel about the racial perspectives coming from the United States by your own perspective?


************Are you interested in Latin American history? So I have a YouTube channel (I won't say the name not to be spammy) and I've been uploading videos for almost 5 months. My favorite topics are history and geography. However, within the realm of history I love talking about Latin American one. Yeah I know that Latin America is made up of several different nation's and we don't have a single united history yet I love each national history on its own and there are several parallelisms amongst them.
I haven't taken the decision to go all for it and turn my channel into a Latin American history channel because I am afraid people won't be interested. 
So I wanted to know your opinion. Are you really keen of and interested in the history of the continent? Or is it too ambitious to tell the stories of such a diverse place as one? Stories that might not appeal to many.
(Note: I know there are a lot of people interested in this topic that ARE NOT Latin Americans, however I make my videos in Spanish, that's why I would like to know if there are actually any latinamerican interested in this)


************What disappointed you the most about living in Europe? Recently I asked about the USA now it‚Äôs turn to Europe. If you  lives/has lived in Europe, what disappointed you the most? 


************Is Your Country Covering the Diplomatic Crisis Between Colombia and Guatemala at the moment? TLDR: the current minister of defense of Colombia, Iv√°n Vel√°squez, used to be head of the UN Anticorruption Commission in Guatemala (CICIG), which took down the government of Otto P√©rez Molina by finding a huge corruption scheme which many sectors of Guatemalan society were involved in.

Subsequent governments expelled CICIG from Guatemala and persecuted those involved in the capture of corrupt agents, including our former Attorney General. Recently, Giammattei‚Äôs government has placed a capture order against Vel√°squez, which is unheard of as he is a high government functionary now, not just some UN agent.


************What do Latin Americans think of the Haitian situation in the Dominican Republic? The current government has gotten much more strict in deporting illegal Haitian migrants back to Haiti, with much of the world powers critique, USA being the most vocal. Our current president has made it clear that the Dominican Republic cannot fix the internal problems Haiti has, or accept more refugees. They have a bigger population, and a history of being held back by western powers, most notably France with their famous slave debt. Along with all the historic confrontations with the DR.

&#x200B;

I was going to list data of why the DR cant help Haiti more than it already is, but id like to have the least biased answers of how you see it or what you have heard and seen.

Edit: Alot of people dont seem to know why there are problems between the two countries and why haiti is so poor, this video explains the history very briefly and directly in 3 minutes: https://youtu.be/isGNQILKM0A


************Argentinians and Brazilians, what do you think about the rivalry between Argentina and Brazil fans in Bangladesh (and other Asian countries)? https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2022/11/18/argentina-brazil-bangladesh-world-cup/


************Can you explain the whole ‚Äúslow pace of life‚Äù stereotype? I‚Äôve heard multiple times that in Latin America, there is a ‚Äúslow pace of life‚Äù, ‚Äúpeople take their time‚Äù, etc. 

Is it merely a stereotype, or is there some truth to it?


************Teach me how to curse in your country Basically the title, if I ever travel to your country and get mad at someone, I want to express how much I'm mad.


************What about we share our finds on Google Maps, with interesting or just random spots? I like to "travel" through Google Street View, when I'm bored. It is a fascinating service, with tons of street images from all around the world. How about we share some locations from Latin America here?

I found the spot just below. It is not a beautiful one, but I think it is very representative from my country.

[https://goo.gl/maps/FgaMGSRxpK8DGJDe9](https://goo.gl/maps/FgaMGSRxpK8DGJDe9)

It has this melancholic vibe, in the bahian inlands. Coca-cola logo doesn't lie, this is under american influence afterall, even in this distant place.

Place looks poor, some buildings seem abandoned (they could be in /r/urbanhell for sure). Yet you have a very lively commerce around it, with some pretty advanced stuff, like banks, tattoo shops, clinical laboratories.

So yeah, I think this shows how complex Brazil is, this is 800 km away from the  state capital (around 500 miles), and even more distant from the big, economic centers in southern Brazil, but even there you have contradictions everywhere.

Place is hot as hell, yet streets look rainy and people dress very conservative, which makes it even more melancholic, with some interesting vibe.

Well, I like to let my mind wonder in those random places. This is so distant from my home (S√£o Paulo), if this was in Europe, it would be in a totally different country. Yet it is still Brazil, I could sit there and order a coxinha in good old portuguese, just as I do right here.

Fascinating, isn't it? Feel free to share your "finds" too!


************Does your country have any famous unsolved mysteries? I'm gonna piggyback off the "Famous serial killers" question posted here earlier. Do you have any unsolved crimes that became famous around the country/the world? 

In Brazil there's the "Caso Evandro" or "As Bruxas the Guaratuba", as it is more known (The Evandro Case/The Witches of Guaratuba). It's a very complicated case involving a shit ton of cultural and political elements, but basically a boy was kidnapped in Paran√° and his body was found a few days later, completely mutilated,  and seven people were judged as responsible for his murder during a black magic ritual. 

However there's not enough evidence to be sure of what actually happened and there's a lot of shady stuff in the investigation, so we can consider it pretty much unsolved. If you speak portuguese, there's a whole podcast about it and it's pretty interesting.

(Let's avoid morbid and gory details for the sake of everyone. Dunno if the sub has any trigger warnings/nsfw warnings I should apply so let me know it is needed)


************How common is it to speak Aymara and Quechua in Peru or Bolivia? 


************why dont brazilians immigrate more? there are only 700,000 born brazilians living in the US, that with in contrast to the brazil's population, it's really a small number. now compare it to other latin-american countries like el salvador, mexico, colombia, guatemala, cuba etca...

and most of the brazilians i know say they would move back if they were paid what they are paid here, and the same speech doesn't happen often with other latinos. they always complain and say they miss brazil, but when talking with brazilians living there, they make it feel like the worst place in the world to live and tell you to never go.


************Is Chino a friendly way to call an Asian? I used to work at a restaurant. Hispanics folks over there called me Chino. I thought it is an offensive term and asked them about it and they said it is normal way of calling Asian people. Still tbh I think they bsing. Are they telling me the truth?


************If unemployment rates are so high in Spain, Why do Latin Americans keep moving there? 


************Do you often use whatsapp stickers? I, as many Chileans I suppose, use whatsapp stickers more than often and as a way of communicating itself. There are just so many contextual ones and I thought that was universal. After moving to the UK, I was told by many other non-LatAm nationalities that stickers are weird and why don't I better use gifs for that. So the question arises: are Chileans also weird because of our love of whatsapp stickers or is that common to other LatAm countries as well?


************What do people exaggerate about Latin America? 


************What the heck is going on in Mexico? So yeah, Im just curious. Years ago, I think it was some months after the case of Ingrid Escamilla I heard "Canciom sin miedo" de Vivir Quintana y El Palomar and became kind of curious and dug deeper and tried to understand it.


Sorry if this is a sensitive topic for some or if im just venting nonsense shit out of my heart but just WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK. I mean, yes, they kill women in my country too, yes, i hate this sick culture of catcalling where if you dont reply with "thanks" they just tell you "pero que odiosa morena" o "ni tan buena que estes" and then you have to walk scared to your house because you dont know if they came after you.

But why does it happen so weirdly in Mexico? It's like they do have criminal minds that allow them to actually kill a person, bury them and try to go on with their lives as if nothing happened. 

I am not comparing tragedies, no one should have to die by the hand of someone who said to love them. But in my country those kind of things usually happen in the house as result of repeated episodes of domestic violence. I can not even start to think which one is worse. There are orphans, whole families destroyed. I can not even imagine losing someone in my family like that. I would literally go insane.

How in hell do you meet a random girl one night and decide you are going to kill her? Do they not think about a mom or siblings or dad that are never going to recover? How tf has the world come to this? 

This is truly supposed to be a consult post, I really am interested on understanding how is this common across all LATAM countries yet in Mexico it seems like more elaborated and evil crimes (actually burying them or even choping bodies). Like, at least give a mother or a sister the right to properly mourn their deads.

No se, algunas cosas son tan macabras que no se me ocurre como pueden salir de una mente humana sencilla.

Edit: tipograf√≠a


************Do you consider Taiwan a country? I know that many of the nations that recognize the island of Taiwan as a country were/are in Latin America and with Nicaragua recently being the latest country to drop recognition I wanted to know how people in the region felt about this issue. Do you think they are a country and why do you think so?


************Do Chileans actually feel that they come from a third-world country? On this subreddit I am surprised to see people from highly-developed countries say that they come from a ‚Äúthird-world‚Äù country, including Chile, Uruguay, Costa Rica, and others. I don‚Äôt really use the term to describe any country, but I especially don‚Äôt understand how these countries could ever be called third-world.

Especially Chile, with extremely low levels of corruption, literacy at 97%, the second-lowest homocide rate in the Western Hemisphere, and a stable democratic system.

Maybe my definition of third-world is wrong, or I‚Äôm missing something about these countries. Or those who use the term are in the minority. I‚Äôd be really interested to hear your insights.


************Argentinos Redditors is santiago del estero really the "Alabama" of Argentina. My Argentine friend told me Santiago del estero is like,if Monterrey,Alabama and Florida had a threesome and the baby was born Argentino...


************Are there saints (or other important religious figure) that come from your country? At least here in Brazil we have a few saints:

Saint Dulce

Saint Anchieta

Saint Roque

And some others that I cant recall their name :P

Now for other religions I dont know what would be their "saint equivalent" or important figure, and more I dont know any that are from Brazil :/

So yeah, any saints or important religious figures from your country?


************Central Americans, in your country, how popular is the idea of a union of Central American countries? How plausible is it? Are you for or against the idea? And if you support the idea, do you prefer the union to be like the US or EU? And which country should/would be included?

And non-Central Americans, what are your thoughts about this union?


************Questions for Venezuelans. How is daily life like due to the hyper inflation crisis and political turmoil? Like how would you live i can't imagine the British pound having no value? How tough is it and how do you guys cope and do you have any hope for the future of your country? Just anything about the Venezuelan crisis i would love to be educated .

&#x200B;

have a great day


************Could a Spanish speaker(using Mexican Spanish as example) Travel from Mexico City to Buenos Ares Without difficultly? Or would the countries dialects make the journey difficult? Note: I‚Äôm Aware that there no highway connection between Panama and Columbia.


************Maduro has claimed victory, thoughts?  What the tittle says, any thoughts? I just find it funny ya claims victory with just over 50%, if you are gonna cheat just go all in lol.


************Do Latin Americans see conquistadores as heroes? Do you see conquistadores like Cortez or Pizarro as heroes? What do you think about the genocide of indigenous people which happened in the colonization process. And do you have indigenous ancestors in your family tree?

Note: Guys I don't want to offend anyone it was just a simple question. Sorry if I offended you. I was just being curious and i didn't have any idea about the answers. I learned and thanks for the answers. If you think it is a ridiculous question sorry for that.


************does your country also has trouble with Chinese illegal fishers? So, i just saw an article about some illegal Chinese fishings boat spending more than 600 thousand hours with all systems turned off in order to avoid detection by the Argentinian navy and coast guard (prefectura naval Argentina) and lots of headlines about them being attacked by this illegal fishers and others were they (law enforcement) reported having to fire upon them, so I ask if any other country has the same level of trouble with this people and how affected your country relationship with China or Chinese immigrants


************Do you think Latin Americans who live in the U.S. tend to be more liberal than those who live in their country? 


************Latin American Etiquette Latin american ettiquitte

Now I know Latin America is huge and diverse, so if anyone just wants to answer for one country thats fine! But I am from the us and want to visit as many latin american countries as I can before im old, but i also dont want to be rude while in those countries, so are there any major (or minor!) etiquette rules I should know? Either broad or country specific answers are much appreciated


************Did you know El Chavo del Ocho's main theme song is actually Beethoven's "Turkish March"? I literally found out about this today

Beethoven's "Turkish March": [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUuOmxzbuWQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUuOmxzbuWQ) (put it in 1,25x speed)

************Easiest/quickest way to piss off your country? How would you efficiently make the people of your country angry?


************How are the native Americans or the indigenous people treated in Latin-America? Hello guys I wondered how the indigenous population is treated in Latin-America. Personally I'm amazigh or berber the natives of North-Africa, and throughout history and also now we are in many cases 2nd class citizens even though we see some progress (very little). A few examples of our treatment:

Our language was banned in Algeria and libya for quite a long time.

Much of our history is being "arabwashed" in the education system

In Morocco Amazigh names are still denied.

Schools throughout the Maghreb deny to teach the berber languages

Do the indigenous people in Latin-America also expierence these kind of things? Obviously when the Americas were founded many native Americans faced genocide but how are things today?


************How did Chile and Uruguay vaccinate so many people in such a short time? According to NYT, Chile has the 4th highest vaccination rate per capita, while Uruguay is 7th. Other countries at the top of the lost are generally really small and much wealthier (UAE, Malta, Iceland, Bahrain, etc). How was it possible for them to vaccinate people this quickly?


************How was Chavez really? Hi, as somebody from Slovakia I don‚Äôt have a clue about LATAM politics, the only politicians I know by name are Bolsonaro and Ch√°vez. Recently I‚Äôve read a lot of comments about how Chavez wasn‚Äôt the greatest president. From media we‚Äôve got idea that he was a truly good president from people, and fighting for not selling oil cheaply to USA. 

So I‚Äôm just curious, how was he really? What things he did good and what bad?


************To all BRs in this sub: Do you also dream with a Pixar movie about Brazil? I watched Coco last year, and since then I have dreamed about a Pixar movie about Brazil. I know they are making one about Italy and one about Colombia, and they also have movies for France, Polynesia, and Mexico. I think it would be interesting for them to make one about Brazil. But not a "Rio" or "Rio 2" kind of film. Like, really, if they made one and just focused on Rio and the Amazon I would cry in frustration.

I was thinking something like more a S√≠tio do Pica-Pau Amarelo-like story where a girl (let's name her Mariana) would have her little brother kidnapped by, dunno, the Cuca and she would have to travel all around the country to rescue him. She would go to places like Ouro Preto, Len√ß√≥is Maranhenses, Serra Ga√∫cha, Salvador, Igua√ßu... And she would meet folkloric entities such as the Curupira, Boitat√°, the Headless Mule, indigenous gods such as Yara and Tupan, and Afro-Brazilian ones such as Yemanj√°. And every new region she would meet different people, different food, different cultures... To show how big Brazil and diverse really is.

Maybe Pixar actually does plan to make a Brazil-centric film in the future, but, seriously, if they make another film about, dunno, a boy from a favela in Rio who wants to be a sambista or something in the Amazon, I would flip. Not that those can't be good stories, but the gringos (and I include other Latin Americans when I say this, you are all gringos to us lol) seem to think we are only that.

Oh, and they should also make it clear that we speak Portuguese, not Spanish. Nothing against the latter, Spanish is a beautiful language, but being the only Portuguese speaking country in all of the Americas, we get kinda protective of our language...

************What unpopular opinion about your country do you have? 


************Do you explore LatAm countries with google maps street view? I like to randomly put street view on Peru and Colombia and just check out some random places or highways. I also do that with very far away Brazilian states in the Amazon, to see how it be (like Roraima). 

Its a shame there's no street view throughout jamaica or guyana cause I would explore it more


************What are your country ‚ÄúPoor man Foods/dishes‚Äù? In DR we have white rice with fried or scrambled eggs (there is a popular says about that dish: Arroz con huevos, comida de cueros‚Äù). Also Black beans Moro with pasta is a dish referred as agriculture worker dish.

************Generally speaking, which South American country has the best English speaking population?? So basically I'm thinking about touring a few South American countries and I'm just curious which countries have the best English speaking population in general. I know that it depends on each person  but I was just curious about the general trend.


************Your country had a "Satanic Panic"? How was it? Hey guys, brazillian here! Don't know how put the flag here haha

I was talking to a childhood friend of mine about some games that our group of firned used to play when we were young. We begin to talk about *Yu-Gi-Oh* Trading Card Game and how the cards were a HUGE trend in whole Brazil, but the popularity of it went down the hills after a big TV Jornal (*Boa noite Brasil*, with *Gilberto Barros*) and some evangelical churchs started to spread a conspiracy theory about the game being satanic and shit. After that, *Yu-Gi-Oh!* was **banned** from schools and some kids (like me) got they cards literally **burned** by our parents/family.

But even before that, we have alot of theories about famous people being satanic and demon possessing toys (like [Fof√£o](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fof%C3%A3o#Lenda_urbana)\* and *Barbie*).

&#x200B;

What about the rest of Latin America, do you had a similar event?

*\*Fof√£o* is actually creep AF :p


************What is a Mandela Effect that happens in your country Inspired by [this lovely thread at r/askeurope](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEurope/comments/t8trel/whats_a_netflix_series_from_any_european_country/), what is a common Mandela Effect that happens/happened at your country?

As for Brazil, *everyone* between 25 and 30 years old will vividly remember that Globo was broadcasting Dragon Ball Z (specifically the episode that Goku turns SSJ3 for the first time) when September 11th happened in NT. They stopped the episode to broadcast the plane crashing in the 2nd tower. 

Hell, *I* remember this. I remember watching DBZ and I remember seeing the 2nd plane crash live. Well, I'm wrong, because Dragon Ball Z was never broadcasted that day. Globo did show the 2nd plane crashing, so I probably saw that, but  not the 1st part. A lot of people will swear on their mother's grave that they were watching Dragon Ball when it unfolded.


************What‚Äôs the most imitated Spanish accent in Latin America currently? For me it has to be Caribbean Spanish accent all my gringo friends have an obsession on sounding like Bad Bunny or Anuel. They said it sounds cool and interesting.


************What is something you dislike about Reddit? 


************How different are the living standards between your biggest cities and the rest of the country?

************Those who have emigrated from their natal country: How are you nowadays? 


************How old were you when you started learning English? How long did it take for you to feel confident? Were you ever afraid to speak it? So curious, he estado aprendiendo Espa√±ol por dos a√±os y yo tengo tanto miedo cuando hablando con mis amigos y otros. Deseo que no tenga miedo, tengo tanto respecto por la gente que aprenden ingl√©s y hablan sin miedo todos los d√≠as (like so much damn respect). Ten√≠a diecinueve a√±os cuando empec√© aprender. 

Oh gosh I hope nothing is wrong in that lol

Also any tips on how to learn more efficiently, any countries I should visit?


************Whats the cutest country in Latin America? I am thinking ecuador. It‚Äôs so small and has those big turtles


************What are the worst parts of you country's culture in your opinion? For Brazil I would say:

  * Disregarding strangers.
  * Disregarding rules.
  * Lack of professionalism (including being late).


************Do you find Americans to be way to nice or talkative ? 
Americans are actually friendly way too friendly where its creepy some times. Could be because I delt mostly with older retired Americans. They seem to want to make alot of small talk.

Europeans specially the French are less personable and more direct


************Is "social cleansing" really a thing in Colombia, or is it media exaggeration? According to reports there are right-wing death squads who go around killing "undesirables" in Colombian cities. [https://colombiareports.com/social-extermination-undesirables-colombia/](https://colombiareports.com/social-extermination-undesirables-colombia/)


************How do you Argentinians feel about your country being compared to Cuba and Venezuela? How true is this ?


************Venezuela announces 6-month rent suspension, guarantees workers‚Äô wages, bans lay-off How are they going to  pay for this? Also why suspend rent if workers wages are gauranteed ? this is a true mind fuck.


************Colombia officially bans child marriage, any thoughts? https://caracol.com.co/2024/11/14/congreso-aprobo-en-ultimo-debate-la-prohibicion-del-matrimonio-infantil-en-colombia/


************What‚Äôs a fact about your country that sounds made up but it‚Äôs actually true? 


************Are there any aspects of "gringo" culture that you respect or admire? 


************Why do latinos speak english to me when I start out speaking spanish to them? this has happened to be in both latin america and western US. I know that many latinos have excellent english, but I personally want more white americans like myself to develop spanish skills. So, when speaking to a person or group who I can hear are already speaking spanish, I will speak spanish too. 

They understand my spanish, but come right back at me with english. I get disappointed because I want the experience to actually USE spanish, but I never know what to do next. I switch over to english because that's what they did, but what would happen if I insisted on speaking in spanish?

Is it offensive?


************Found this comparison table on Wikipedia, is it accurate for your country? And if your country is not in South America, how do you say these words?

************What do you think of Biden saying Latin America is 'the front yard of the US'? [https://marketresearchtelecast.com/president-joe-biden-says-latin-america-is-not-americas-backyard-but-the-front/242515/](https://marketresearchtelecast.com/president-joe-biden-says-latin-america-is-not-americas-backyard-but-the-front/242515/)

&#x200B;

> ‚ÄúWe used to talk when I was a young man in the U.S. backyard college, but it‚Äôs not the backyard, I think south of the Mexican border is the front yard of the U.S. We‚Äôre people alike,‚Äù 

IDK, it sounds weird. It's like he's trying too hard to appeal to Latin America.


************Have you ever faced racism in your life? 


************What or who gets too much hate in Latin America? 


************How do you feel about people from the First World who refer to their countries as shitholes or ''capitalist dystopias''? 


************What are the answers this sub doesn't want to hear? Basically, which comments get you down voted the most. You don't have to believe what you say.


************Foreigners who are dating Latin Americans, what is it like compared to dating someone from your home country? 


************Were there any plans to turn your country into a monarchy? If so, what were they? I only know about the French invasion and Maximilian in Mexico, as well as Juan Jose Flores' scheming in exile to turn Ecuador into one.


************What is the difference between Latino America Spanish and Spain Spanish? Is it like small grammical changes like when comparing British to American English or is it very different?


************¬øHow is viewed/used the word "Maric√≥n" (faggot) in ur country? I was talking to a friend from Spain and I called him "marica" and he told me saying that is very offensive towards gays.

In Colombia is very common, is like saying dude in the USA, tho sometimes it can be offensive, is very weird to that by the case, dudes call each other like that in a daily basis.

Edit: Also i would like to add, that here Marica is also used as dumb, for example, if u say ‚Äúno seas marica‚Äù it can mean dont be dumb, or don‚Äôt do that.


************Political tensions grow in Brazil while Coronavirus terrorises our population. What is going on in your country right now? After the justice minister(Sergio Moro) left, the right wing split. The liberals don't support the government anymore. There are over 30 impeachment requests in the congress. Bolsonaro supporters are calling for protests and violence against the opposition. The opposition is divided wether to support Moro or continue their crusade against the right wing. Center - right parties are growing excited with the prospect of Sergio Moro in one of them. Things are getting tough here and I fear the worst. What is going on in your country rn?


************Why do you think Latin Americans are stereotyped as being socially conservative but at the same time as "sexually liberated"/promiscuous? I've noticed this a lot when outsiders talk about Latina women. They're stereotyped as being potential trad wives but also "fiery" in the sexual sense.


************Is cactus commonly eaten in your country? Here in Mexico we do eat cacti, i'd even consider it to be an staple in our cuisine. There are many types of cacti and succulents that are usually eaten in Mexico.

The most common example are [nopales](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQ4lA1HknOVK9IlhGYWnfLhkDBRBMELTcly_g&usqp=CAU). You can eat them in [scrambled eggs](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQr9XwKr5U8f9PMImr5QaSTc6m4wBtoLWh4aw&usqp=CAU), [salads](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcT9q2FK4heFiOLATG6pzKka3mCEA7AIcJrWyg&usqp=CAU), [stews](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQzND2UyCicTW5ZGRUeZppK9FJIZ9hPaEZuLA&usqp=CAU), [grilled](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRy_CAGVFZ9_HUBVtA3fbWcplU2eov4grlzfA&usqp=CAU), [juiced](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcT1EflWqgcsfdtjwSu0Fk3po5ScMxUCwy5qXg&usqp=CAU), as a base for meat and cheese (we call that [huaraches](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTfUbGPswQ0tDAcjFEL6LWNCh2PRlPdraWpZw&usqp=CAU)) and obviously as [tacos](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQz1qxLwD1osc94GCq_qD5xRtq-H1FbDBpAjA&usqp=CAU). Even [nopal flour](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQ_8qG_90JamvkA5pZ3JCC0RwfTFjDQ77dWhw&usqp=CAU) is a thing these days.

Are cacti used as food outside of Mexico or is it just a Mexican thing? (not talking about the fruit like tunas and pitayas, i'm talking about the cactus itself).


************Which city in your country is loved by foreigners but hated by the country's native citizens? In Brazil it's Rio de Janeiro for sure.

You can talk to Brazilians from the north and south, most of them have a very negative opinion about that city.

But foreigners love it.


************Why are people from outside Latin America unaware that black Latin Americans exist in countries other than the Dominican Republic? Do you find this to be the case? In my experience whenever people hear a person of African descent speaking Spanish, they are instantly assumed to be Dominican.

Colombia, Puerto Rico, Cuba, and Panama also have large populations of African descent. Proportionally they make up a smaller percentage of the total population compared to people of African descent who make up the majority of Dominicans, but there are many Latinos even in the US who come from these countries who are black. 

Why are Dominicans the only Afro-Latin American population people are aware exists?
