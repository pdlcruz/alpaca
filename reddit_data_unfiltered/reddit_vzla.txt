Un corazón herido se despide Hola a todos,

Este será mi último mensaje. Durante los últimos días, hemos hecho todo lo que estaba en nuestras manos para resistir. **Estoy profundamente agradecido a todos los que me apoyaron con información, fuentes, videos, y a quienes brindaron medicinas y atención en hospitales a los heridos. Sus esfuerzos fueron un faro de esperanza en medio de la oscuridad.**

Sin embargo, estoy completamente derrotado y abatido. Mi mente y mi corazón ya no pueden soportar más. Hice todo lo que pude: salí a entregar medicamentos, suturas, comida; ayudé a grabar la verdad que muchos querían ocultar. ¿Y cuál fue el precio de mi esfuerzo? La vida de mi hermano. Lo asesinaron y algunos tuvieron la desvergüenza de burlarse de su muerte. Nunca había entendido la frase "obtienes lo que mereces" hasta ahora. Ahora lo comprendo con amargura, y deseo de todo corazón que aquellos que nos dieron la espalda sientan el vacío y el dolor de perder a un ser querido.

He llegado al límite. Me iré, dejando atrás un país que me ha arrebatado todo lo que amaba. Aquí sólo quedan malos recuerdos, mi hermano fallecido, un pueblo que sobrevive con migajas, mis padres obligados a huir, **y personas que venderían su dignidad por un bono de $10.**

Recuerden siempre la frase: "Obtienes lo que mereces".

Para aquellos que apoyaron valientemente, fue un honor luchar a su lado. A quienes no pueden marcharse, les pido que encuentren la fuerza para seguir adelante.

Con todo mi corazón, les envío un abrazo enorme. Al menos sé que algunos de ustedes demostraron más valentía que muchos otros.

Adiós.

Many people argue that Juan Guaidó is not the president of the republic, or that there's a coup d'etat in Venezuela. Other argue that the legitime president of Venezuela is Nicolas Maduro because he won elections, and therefore he should be president. There are so many people who want to know the true but they simply find biased information provided by government-funded agents such as TelesurTV that have clearly a bad reputation when it comes to report the venezuelan humanitarian crisis, the constitutional crisis, and every other aspect that you may find necessary to really understand what is going on Venezuela. To understand how we are here, we must learn about past events like designation of judges to the Supreme Court, derogation of the presidential referendum, dissolution of the parliament, a new designation of judges to the Supreme Court, and other things that I will try to put down in an effort to let people know what actually happened since 2013 to 2019.

#First of all. How did Maduro came to presidency?

He was named vicepresident by Chavez, then Chavez died in 2013 which leaves Maduro as the interim president until new elections were convened in april of 2013, which Maduro claims he won, but the opposition contested and called to count the ballots something that the electoral body never does unless it is asked because the results are always issued electronically. The electoral body (put in there by the socialist party) didn't accept the petition to count the ballots.

#2015 parliament elections

After the electoral body didn't accept to count the ballots, the discontent against the regime grew among the population, allowing the opposition to keep winning popular support. On December 6 of 2015 parliament elections were hold. The opposition won with 56% of the votes, something that many people didn't expect. The opposition obtained 2/3 of the seats in the parliament.

Both Maduro and the opposition recognized the results as the electoral body claimed that there were not any irregularities

#13 new judges illegaly named

On December 22, 2015, the incumbent parliament members who were elected back in 2010 illegaly named 13 new judges to the Supreme Court, something that should have happened not in 2015 but in 2016. The vast majority of these new judges were parliament members the same day they were appointed to the Supreme Court. They even were the ones who proposed in the parliament to name new judges, and of course, they were members of the socialist party. The parliament back then was still controlled by the socialist party.

#The Supreme Court declares null the election of deputies elected in December 6 of 2015

One of the socialist deputies who was illegaly named judge to the Supreme Court in December 22th of 2015, declared null the election of several opposition deputies in Amazonas state. This caused the opposition to lose the 2/3 of the parliament that it obtained after winning the election of December 6.

#166 deputies sworn in to the parliament, including Amazonas' deputies

On January 6 of 2016, 112 opposition deputies were sworn in to the parliament, including those who were elected in the Amazonas whose election was contested

#The Supreme Court outlaws the parliament

After the opposition-held parliament decided to sworn in three deputies who were elected in the contested Amazonas circuit, the supreme court decided, at petition of one parliament member of the socialist party, to outlaw the entire parliament alleging they disobey the orders to not swear in the Amazonas' deputies.

#The opposition calls for a presidential referendum

According to the venezuelan constitution, you can recall any elected official after having completed half of the term for which the official was elected. This was the case for Maduro's presidential term which was at its half in April of 2016. The opposition wanted to recall and started the process to do so in April of 2016, but first, according to the constitution, they needed to follow a procediment to collect signatures which must be verified by the electoral body. The opposition needed only 300,000 signatures, they instead collected 2,1 millions of signatures

The opposition parties did call for the presidential recall, not the parliament. Just for clarification.

#Electoral body cancels the presidential recall

Because of 10,000 suspicious signatures, the electoral body decided to cancel the entire presidential recall, this caused a huge discontent among the population. This excuse to cancel the presidential recall was already an obvious attempt from the electoral body to protect Nicolas Maduro

#The parliament annuls the designation of judges to the Supreme Court

Because they were illegaly named, the opposition-held parliament decided in June of 2016 to annul the designation of the 13 judges who were named back in December of 2015.

#3 deputies who were sworn in, were taken out

Beginning in 2017, in its first ordinary session, the parliament, then chaired by Julio Borges, deputy for the opposition coalition, officially disbanded the 3 challenged deputies, fulfilling the condition of the Supreme Court to exit contempt. However, the Supreme Court did not withdraw the contempt alleging that the old directive presided by Henri Ramos Allup is the one who must do the formalities

#Supreme Court granted legislative powers to Nicolas Maduro

In March 27 of 2017, the Supreme Court granted legislative powers to Nicolas Maduro, however, they quickly clarified the judgement by issuing a clarification where the judges supressed to grant legislative powers to both the Supreme Court and Nicolas Maduro

#Nicolas Maduro calls for a constituent assembly, to create a new constitution

On May 1, 2017, Nicolas Maduro, issued a decree to convene a National Constituent Assembly (ANC) based on a controversial interpretation of articles 347, 348 and 349 of the Constitution. This call again ignited the alarms of Venezuelan society, as many jurists point out that Maduro has violated the Constitution by usurping the functions of the sovereign people when calling a Constituent Assembly, when this power corresponds strictly to the People of Venezuela as a whole and not to people in particular. A Constituent Assembly is a supranational body, all-powerful institution that can change from the education curriculum to remove any officials of any branch of the government, including the president of the republic, reform or derogate the criminal code. 

It would not be the first time a constituent assembly would be convened. Back in 1998 Chavez did the same, but first he called for a consultative referendum to decided whether the people agreed to convene elections to elect constituent deputies. If the results of the consultative referendum were against the election of constituent deputies then there won't be any constituent assembly at all. Nicolas Maduro didn't allow the people the chance to vote in a consultative referendum to decide whether we wanted a constituent assembly or not. He just directly call for elections to elect constituent deputies implying there will be a constituent assembly.

This move to call for a constituent assembly was seen as parallel national assembly.

#"Maduro is the people"

On June 7, 2017, the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court handed down judgment 378, which determined that the president was authorized to convene a constituent without a prior consultative referendum, since he acted in the name of the sovereignty of the people. Article 5 of the Constitution establishes that the sovereignity "resides intransferably among the people." People argue that Maduro himself can't act in the name of the entire population for these matters.

#Attorney General filed a contentious electoral appeal agains the constituent assembly

On June 8, the Attorney General, Luisa Ortega Díaz, filed to the Supreme Court a contentious electoral appeal and precautionary relief for all purposes of the constituent assembly and, invoking Article 333 of the Constitution, invited all Venezuelans to join the appeal in order to stop the constituent assembly and preserve the validity of the current Constitution. The next day the vicinity of the Supreme Court was closed by State security forces preventing citizens from adhering to the appeal filed by the attorney general

#Illegal appoinment of 13 judges elected in 2015 was contested by the attorney general

On July 2, 2017, the attorney general challenged the appointment of the 13 principal judges and 21 substitutes  after it was known that in the process of appointing these judges, the Republic Moral Council (formed by the Citizen's Branch which includes the attorney general, the ombudsman, and comptroller) did not hold an extraordinary session to evaluate the scales of application, as established in Article 74 of the LOTSJ (Organic Law of the Suprme Court), but they sent the files of the candidates and then presented the minutes to sign it, which she refused to do so because the session had not been held. The next day, the ombudsman presented a document with the alleged signature of the attorney general alleging that she had signed the act. María José Marcano, former secretary of the Republic Moral Council accused the ombudsman of lying and presenting a forged document, because neither she nor the attorney general had signed the act as it was an act performed illegally due to political pressures

#Attorney general was dismissed by the Supreme Court

At petition of a socialist parliament member, the Supreme Court dismissed the attorney general and granted its powers to the ombudsman that are exclusive of the Public Ministry

#Opposition-held parliament appoints 13 new judges to the Supreme Court

Once the attorney general contested the election of the 13 judges to the Suprme Court illegaly appointed in december of 2015 by deputies of the socialist party, on July 21 of 2017 the opposition-held parliament decided to follow the procediment fulfill the necessity to appoint new judges to the Supreme Court. This time, every aspect of the process was fulfilled. Days later, Maduro started to jail these judges, however, many could flee the country before being kidnapped.

However, they are functioning as the legitime Supreme Court since it was named by the opposition-held parliament.

#Elections to the constituent assembly take place on July 30

The only candidates were members of the socialist party because the electoral bases were designed to avoid any other person not affiliated to the party to be candidate. Only socialist party members could be candidate to the constituent assembly.

The election was denounce by most western countries, including Canada, the EU, Australia, among others.

#Constituent assembly calls for presidential election

On January 23, 2018, the constituent assembly decreed that the presidential election scheduled for late 2018, should be held before April 30. Several countries in America and Europe have expressed their disavowal of the results due to the impediment of opposition parties participation and the lack of time for the lapses established in the electoral regulations. 

Two days later, on January 25, the Supreme Court ordered the electoral body to exclude from these elections the ballot of the Democratic Unity Table (opposition coalition), arguing that within that coalition there are parties that have not complied with the validation process of political parties established in the law.

#Presidential election took place on May 20, 2018

The only candidates were Nicolas Maduro, ex chavista Henri Falcón, and the evangelical pastor Javier Bertucci. Maduro obtained 68% of the votes. Henri Falcon didn't recognize the results, as did many countries around the world and the rest of the opposition parties.

The election was rigged as electoral observers including the Carter Certer condemned the election.

The parliament rejected the election.

#Supreme Court in exile annul presidential election

On July of 2018, the Supreme Court that was named by the opposition-held parliament issued a decree to nullify the presidential election, ordering the parliament to name an interim president. [Source](https://www.elnuevoherald.com/noticias/mundo/america-latina/venezuela-es/article214387874.html)

#Christian Zerpa defects and flees to the US

On January 8, 2019, Christian Zerpa, one of the 13 judges named illegaly in 2015 by socialist parliament members, who also accepted the petition to outlaw opposition-held parliament, defected and fled to the United States, this being motivated by disagreeing with the swearing in of Nicolás Maduro for a second presidential term. Zerpa made a series of statements that questioned the independence of powers and the transparency of Venezuelan justice.

He confessed that he was appointed as a judge in the express process of 2015, because he had always been loyal to Chavez.

#Maduro swore in to the presidency

After the presidential election that took place in May 20 of 2018, Maduro swore in to the presidency on January 10 of 2019. This must be done in the parliament but this time he did it in the Supreme Court. 

#Legislative year ended, new body president is approved

Juan Guaidó was elected president of the legislative branch on January 5 of 2019

#Presidential term ended in January 10 of 2019 without an elected president of the republic

The parliament, after rejecting the election back then in May of 2018 and following the judgement issued on July of 2018 by the Supreme Court in exile, stated that there is not an elected president of the republic.

The powers of the executive branch must be transferred to the president of the legislative branch. 

#Juan Guaidó assumes executive powers, swore in in January 23 of 2019

As an interim president, he must call for elections in the next 30 days, however, there may be some inconvenients about having elections right now. Therefore, he called for a transitory government.

#FAQ

#What happened to the 13 judges named by the opposition-held parliament, and to the attorney general Luisa Ortega?

The new Supreme Court is fulfilling his duties in another country, as they're recognize by the OAS and the US.

Luisa Ortega now is exiled. She was replaced by the William Saab who was the ombudsman at the time she fled the country. The vice-ombudsman became the ombudsman.

#Was the 2018 presidential election legitime?

The body who must convene the election must be the electoral body. For the 2018 presidential elections, the constituent assembly was the one who called for presidential election. If you don't recognize the constituent assembly, then you don't recognize neither the election it convened for.

#Why we don't recognize the constituent assembly?

Because we didn't had a consultative referendum to decide whether we wanted a constituent assembly or not.


#Why did the opposition parties boycott the election to elect constituent deputies?

The electoral bases for the election of constituent deputies, that took place in june 30 of 2017, were rigged. Only socialist party members were allowed to be candidate. The opposition parties were not allowed to have candidates. They don't even boycotted the election, they couldn't even be candidates.

#Is Venezuela a socialist country?

Yes, it is.

#70% of the Venezuela's economy is privately owned?

No, it isn't. In order to be on privately owned you first need private property rights. That's to say, if you own something, you then can put prices to products and even distribute/sell or buy whatever amount you want. That is not the case for Venezuela as most of its economy is actually collectively owned, based on socialist principles.

You can't put prices to products, and you get exprorpriated if you produce basic goods, for example. You can't sell them for profit.

************Mathematics expose amateurish fraud in Venezuela elections CNE (National Electoral Council) in Venezuela [announced](https://x.com/cneesvzla/status/1817953254208110756) that; Maduro won elections by **51,2** percentage and **5.150.092** votes. Opposition candidate Edmundo Gonzalez got **44,2** percentage with **4.445.978** votes, others got **4,6** percentage with **462.704** votes. Total amount of votes announced to be **10.058.774**.

But here is the problem, unrounded percentages shows that:

Maduro got **51,199997%** of the total votes (almost exactly 52,2%) ,

Edmundo Gonzales got **44,199998%** of the total votes (almost exactly 44,2%)

Others got **4,600003%** of the total votes (almost exactly 4,6%)

So unrounded percentages and rounded percentages of candidates are almost exactly same. Probability of this happening in any real election is **0.000001% (*****almost*** ***1 in 100.000.000*****),** which is close to zero. This results shows that CNE amateurishly fabricated vote figures based on pre-determined rounded percentages without taking into account that probability of unrounded percentages being same as rounded ones is close to zero.

For example in 2020 US presidential elections, when percentages are rounded up; Joe Biden got 51,3% (81,283,501 votes from total of 158,429,631) while Donald Trump got 46,8% (74,223,975 votes from total of 158,429,631). But exact unrounded percentages are like this: Joe Biden got 51,305744% while Donald Trump got 46,849806% of total votes. Extended digits of unrounded percentages in any ordinary election would look like this. Not like 51,299999% or 46,800001%.

**Methodology of the fraud**: CNE multiplied pre-determined exact percentages they choose beforehand with pre-determined total votes to find individual results. Raw individual results naturally are not rounded numbers, so they had to round the raw unrounded results to reach final individual votes :

|Pre-determined exact percentages|Pre-determined total votes|Unrounded results for individual votes|
|:-|:-|:-|
||||
|51.2%|× 10,058,774 =|5,150,092.288|
|44.2%|× 10,058,774 =|4,445,978.108|
|4.6%|× 10,058,774 =|462,703.604|

When you round the unrounded result (5,150,092.288) for Maduro, it's exactly same as the result CNE announced (**5.150.092**) for Maduro.

When you round the unrounded result (4,445,978.108) for Edmundo Gonzalez, it's exactly same as the result CNE announced (**4.445.978**) for Edmundo Gonzalez.

When you round the unrounded result (462,703.604) for others, it's exactly same as the result CNE announced (**462.704**) for others.

This is why final exact percentages for candidates (51,199997%, 44,199998%, 4,600003%) are slightly different from pre-determined percentages CNE used in calculation (51,200000%, 44,200000%, 4,600000%) because CNE had to round the unrounded vote figures (5,150,092.288, 4,445,978.108, 462,703.604) they founded by multiplying pre-determined percentages and pre-determined total votes, to reach final vote figures:

*1-When you round 5,150,092.288 it goes slightly* ***below***\*: to 5,150,092.000, therefore 51,200000% goes to 51,199997%.\*

*2-When you round 4,445,978.108 it goes slightly* ***below***\*: to 4,445,978.000, therefore 44,200000% goes to 44,199998%.\*

*3-When you round 462,703.604 it goes slightly* ***above***\*: to 462.704.000, therefore 4,600000% goes to 4,600003%.\*

In conclusion, election results perfectly match with presumed methodology of the fraud. It's very convenient that final exact percentages (51,199997%, 44,199998%, 4,600003%) are slightly below or above of pre-determined percentages (51,200000%, 44,200000%, 4,600000%) depending on whether rounded up number goes below or above, which shows correlation. Therefore there is close to zero chance that this can naturally happen. Maduro and CNE conducted most amateurish fraud in modern electoral history.

Hello everyone, I was wondering whats the ground reality like in Venezeula, I saw horrific reports of huge inflation and massive shortages (long lines). How are people coping with this? I mean from the videos I saw income and jobs weren't an issue but just not having enough goods was a problem. Are people going hungry and stuff cause of shortages. Is there any bright future in sight? My grievances to you all it seems really bad at least on video. It would be really nice if one of you could describe your day-day avg schedule cause I don't really know how much the media portrays/twists the reality.

Edit: Thanks for the awesome answers guys. It has given me deep insight, and really the situation is bad. I was also wondering if you spend soo much of the time standing in lines how do people earn enough to buy the products (clearly you can't work on the day ur standing for line, you cud work every alternate day but I feel like it would be hard to earn enough)? Also has inflation impacted the savings you guys had? If so how did people try to get around it?

************Guia para que dejen de preguntar la misma guebonada todos los putos dias: Trabajo remoto para pajuos (como tu). Miren mmgvos malparios. Me tienen el guevo flaco ya preguntando estupideces por aca y que "ains se puede hacer plata por internet??" De pana todos los dias el mismo guevo de goma y que ladilla ya. Saben por que no tienen trabajo? porque no saben usar la puta funcion de busqueda de reddit que esta alla arriba para buscar la vaina. En vez de preguntar guebonadas, por que no lo buscan primero? O, mejor aun, hablen con panas, gente o instruyanse etc. Equis todo eso es irrelevante dado que me tomare la molestia de escribir una puta guia para hacer plata por internet.

Requerimientos:

1. Saber ingles (no es opcional. "me defiendo jejes" no sirve. O sabes o no sabes. mmgvo entiende una vaina si no sabes ingles no eres nadie ni nada. Todas tus opciones son limitadas asi ni te des cuenta. Si no sabes ingles deja de leer esta mierda y metete la paloma verde del duolingo hasta que te salga por la jeta y ve la cagada de serie esa que te gusta tanto en netflix en ingles con subtitulos en ingles. En un mes aprendiste mas que un semestre en el CVA. Que esos mediocres se sigan muriendo de hambre.)
2. Tener donde recibir los billullos (paypal y facebank recomendado, desconozco otras plataformas. A veces algunos empleadores pagan por binance, lo cual a mi parecer no es malo).
3. (debio probablemente ser numero 1 pero equis). Tener internet estable y una laptop que no sea un dolor de cabeza. Sabes lo que es estupido? que te boten por tener can'tv, o porque tu laptop no puede abrir asana, un video de youtube y un .pdf al mismo tiempo
4. Tener algun plan de contingencia si se va la luz. No tiene que ser una planta. En amazon venden power banks ("power stations") con los que puedes cargar la laptop. Los prefiero a los UPS.
5. Bonus: Saber otras cosas que no sean solo "saber ingles". Programacion es super demandado, una carrera universitaria, experiencia laboral te van a facilitar mucho el camino, pero no son requerimientos.

"Aja mmgvo se ingles, estoy en 5to semestre en la jose maria vargas y me abri un paypal ahi todo pirata. Tengo tambien una canaimita que corre LoL, gafo. Tambien le hice un puente ahi a la bateria de la moto y me carga la lapto'. Ahora que hago?"

Esta parte es mucho mas corta de lo que quisiera, pero hay 3 paginas donde he conseguido empleo de una manera u otra.

[Indeed.com](https://indeed.com/)

[Upwork.com](https://upwork.com/)

[Essayshark.com](https://essayshark.com/)

Y esta que no he usado

[fiverr.com](https://fiverr.com/)

EDIT: Adicionalmente, aqui mismo en reddit hay subreddits que ofrecen trabajitos.

r/forhire 

r/slavelabour 

r/DoneDirtCheap

Cada una de esas paginas tiene sus mariqueras e idiosincrasias. Un tutorial en youtube probablemente haga un mejor trabajo que yo en explicar como funcionan.

Para mi [Indeed.com](https://indeed.com/) es buena para conseguir un empleo estable, pero generalmente subpagado para los estandares de "trabajar por internet". Aunque probablemente es mucho mas de lo que ganas ahorita si trabajas en una empresa nacional o, dios te guarde, en un negocio semi-formal. Esta es sencilla. Aplica a todo lo que puedas. Probablemente te vayan a contratar.

Upwork es menos pirata pero mucho mas competitiva. Paga generalmente mejor y los trabajos son mejores. Esta tiene su propia moneda para aplicar a los trabajos y te dan una cantidad limitada al abirirte una cuenta. Asi que no te vuelvas loco a aplicar a todo lo que veas. Se selectivo.

En essayshark creo que un pana me ayudo a abrir la cuenta. Esa hacerle bid a los trabajos es un trabajo de por si. Pero se puede hacer platica bien, sobre todo si sabes programar. Tengo años que no trabajo por aca. Pero en su momento me genero platica bien.

FAQ

* Que significa FAQ?

Aprende Ingles

* me dijiste que no era nada :(

Callate y aprende ingles. Me lo agradeceras luego.

* Aja mmgvo tu tanta paja que hablas en que trabajas y cuanto ganas al mes?

Buen intento seyor seniat. Soy estudiante tiempo completo y no produzco ni genero nada

* Deberia dejar mi trabajo que, si bien no paga bien, a futuro me dara las herramientas para una carrera profesional?

No. Esa es la gran trampa de estos trabajos. Sirven para ganar plata a corto plazo. Pero generalmente (no siempre). Son trabajos que no tienen mucho futuro.

* Marico no quiero andar llamando gente para venderle guebonadas por $400 al mes :(

Nadie te esta obligando.

* Que tanto se puede ganar en estos trabajos sinceramente?

Si le echas bola y te armas, 4 cifras verdes estan a tu alcance. Conozco gente que ni titulo universitario tienen y ganan relativamente bien

* Todo esto suena muy bueno para ser verdad. Que ganas tu?

Que la gente deje de preguntar la misma mmgvada todos los putos dias.

************Kind letter to all the socialists out there who back Maduro I understand that you are a socialist, unfortunately there are many socialists in the world. I am an economist and during our studies we learned a lot about socialism and communism. We have to start from utopian socialism, Saint-Simon, Fourier, Owen, among others. We read the Communist Manifesto and many analysis of The Capital by Marx and other texts. I believe that our opinion is not hollow and is based on facts. I know that many of us who repudiate socialism also do so because we are living in this disaster country.

My main problem with those who consider themselves socialists is the lack of moral in backing Maduro or his regime. Just because you identify with an ideology doesn't mean you're going to follow it blindly. You have to be self-critical and ask yourself questions before you support a tyrant.

Stop supporting tyrants who adapt to your beliefs. Just as you can't defend a pedophile priest just because you're Catholic, you can't defend a dictator because he's a socialist.

Another thing, be very clear that this is not a right vs. left conflict. This is a conflict of oppressors and oppressed. A privileged few vs. a lot of suffering. Enough of the immoral attitude of supporting a tyrant and a totalitarian regime.

Today you can take advantage of the day to see the great concentrations that there will be in support of the transitional government and the end of this regime that for 20 years has plundered this country and led it to misery.

**Edit:** Thank you very much for your comments and gold. Apparently /r/socialist and similar comrades didn't like my post very much because yesterday the post was 98% upvoted and today it's 89%. You are a hopeless case most of you and those who defined themselves as socialists and gave an opinion with respect to those who think differently, my compliments.

************Yo estoy ya es arrecho con esta vaina. Esto es para desahogarme, porque de pana estoy indignado. Hermano, literalmente nos acaban de pasar el guebo por la cara con las elecciones, están persiguiendo y matando gente, hablando de crear campos de concentración, hablando de bloquear WhatsApp, ¿Y después de todo eso que pasa? En la calle que todo el maldito mundo como si nada hubiese pasado! Los empresarios prefieren abrir los negocios para vender 4 mariqueras al día, y los trabajadores prefieren asistir para que no los boten de su horrible trabajo de 30$ semanales. ¿Es en serio...?

Luego está Maria Corina, fino, tienes las actas, demostraste con pruebas legítimas que Maduro hizo fraude. ¿Y que sigue? ¿Continuar convocando marchas, hablar por 15 minutos de que "ganamos", y luego todo el mundo pa' su casa? No me jodas...

Antes de que me lo digan, no estoy pesimista, lo que estoy es arrecho de ver que este gobierno nos hizo un robo insólito en la historia de este país, y que la gente esté comenzando a resignarse a eso.  
  
La comunidad internacional NO va hacer nada, mucho menos teniendo a Colombia y Brasil en su silencio cómplice, pidiéndole a Maduro "actas" que ellos mismos saben que no existen.

Y los militares dificilmente se van a alzar, la cúpula es totalmente chavista, y los de menor rango no se van a arriesgar a voltearse y terminar presos. 

1 semana, literalmente es lo único que hace falta, 1 semana sin nadie abriendo negocios, todo el mundo manifestando. Estoy seguro de que no lo aguantarían. "Pe-pero la represión..." Chamo como van a reprimir a una avalancha de millones distribuídos en todo el país? "Pe-pero la gente tiene que comer, por eso van al trabajo" Hermano nadie se ha muerto por 1 semana sin trabajar...

Yo no se que le pasó a este país... Pasamos de libertar a medio maldito continente, a dejar que una dictadura nos robe unas elecciones, y no hacer nada al respecto. Pareciera como si aquí la gente ya se acostumbró a la mediocridad eterna como en Cuba.

Igualmente estoy abierto a opiniones distintas, ¿Creen que estoy equivocado? ¿Que lo correcto es tomarse las cosas con calma y eventualmente esta gente caerá por su propio peso?

************Tengo que pedir disculpas Yo y muchos acá hemos estado respondiendo de manera cínica ante la esperanza de las personas por un cambio de gobierno luego de las elecciones de este domingo. Los que simplemente nos adapatamos a la situación y logramos "resolver" nos volvimos indiferentes al sentimiento nacional de repudio al chavismo ya que sentimos que no nos quita ni nos pone. Se podría argumentar que hasta nos hizo más fuertes y logramos cosas de las que no nos creiamos capaces.

Pero también muy probablemente no era el caso hace 7-9 años. Estos días he tenido mucha retrospectiva sobre todo lo que he pasado desde que Maduro nos volvió pobres a todos de un día para otro luego de su primer robo de elecciones. Este domingo, aunque mi lógica me dice que es inutil, voy a votar. No por mi, sino por el carajo de hace 7 años que se sentía en un hueco sin fondo y se le mojaban los ojos solo con pensar en la posibilidad de un cambio.

Los invito a todos los que piensan abstenerse este domingo a pensar: **"Que opinaría el yo de hace 7 años?"**.

Y disculpenme todos los que mantuvieron la esperanza a pesar de todo.


************wtf 


************Este país es una maldición Honestamente no sé cómo hace la gente para no volverse loca aquí. A menos que seas enchufado o gente de plata, sobrevivir aquí es un infierno y siento que le chupa la vida a uno. 

En mi caso he logrado medio sobrevivir con trabajos remotos, haciendo de asistente o customer service. Pero igual eso no alcanza cuando tienes que cuidar a varios miembros de tu familia algunos que ni trabajan. Estuve mes y pico sin trabajar pq los gringos de mi último trabajo eran unos pajuos y decidí renunciar.. en ese mes me quedé sin ahorros..  Justo esta semana conseguí uno nuevo, lo primero que me dijo el gringo fue: "no te cortan la electricidad en tu zona? Pq no quiero problemas con eso" Y le dije que sí, pero que tenía los medios pa que no me afectara. Bueno, se me ha dañado el malayo mini UPS del internet y el de mi laptop, capaz por los 500 bajones al día. Justo cuando no tengo dinero y apenas voy empezando. Y ahora en Maracaibo han decidido cortarnos la luz 4/5 horas hasta dos veces al día. 

Verga mi pana, no sé cómo hacen pa no matarse pq esto es simplemente insoportable. Con razón un amigo de Mérida me dijo que la gente andaba saltando puentes. Es como si el país está hecho para que uno falle. Cada vez que medio se consigue una solución te jode. Y ni pa irme del país pq con qué putas dinero si todo se lo chupan las responsabilidades que tengo. No sé qué maldición pagamos los venezolanos pero vergacion. Como creo que dice un meme por ahí, Diosito ayúdame o elimíname.

Thank you for coming to my Ted-Talk

Edit: vine a desahogarme y lo menos que esperaba era recibir tantos comentarios con apoyo y buenos consejos. Es loco creer que a pesar de la maldición que nos cayó a los venezolanos, aún tengamos tantas buenas vibras que dar. Gracias a los que me comentaron, fuerza a ustedes también. Que todos salgamos de esta

************Chavez and Maduro's "Socialist Bolivarian Revolution" are responsible for the crisis and problems in Venezuela: A chronology of 20 years of socialism destroying a country. &nbsp;

#Chavez and Maduro's "Socialist Revolution" was responsible of the collapse of the Venezuela: A Chronology of 20 years of socialism destroying a country.

&nbsp;

---
---

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Chavez **[once promised "socialism or death"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6lIgRXN-zM)**, claiming that Venezuela needed to become socialist to become a prosper nation and that capitalism would only lead to collapse. 

One has to wonder if he mixed both terms when making this claim. And that is because as of now, what once was a rich and wonderful country is now one of the poorest and most dangerous ones of the region at the border of collapse. Venezuela has reached the shocking number of **[1,300,000% of annual inflation (not overall inflation) in November 2018](https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-economy/venezuela-annual-inflation-tops-1-million-pct-in-november-congress-idUKKBN1O91WT)** and the number keeps growing more and more.

But there is no doubt Chavez meant those words, he went as far as to **[proudly proclaim himself to be a Socialist, Bolivarian, Marxist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqV1BpDxy6c)** and to start a *"Bolivarian socialism revolution of the XXI Century"* in Venezuela.

And Venezuela is a socialist country, a socialist country model controlled and regulated by the government.

But why so much inflation? Experts agree [it is because goods shortage.](https://gestion.pe/economia/venezuela-produce-30-comida-necesaria-mantener-poblacion-153242)

But why does this happen? 

Because the socialist system destroyed the country.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

#**Socialism in action: Expropriation and seizing of private property:**

One of the core aspects of socialism is the restriction of private property. The state controls and owns the production supposedly to provide a better life for the citizens since "the state knows better". 

Chavez dutifully followed this dogma, expropriating private property without any concern:

* [Chavez pointing his finger at privately owned family business and saying "expropriate it".](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOjvJAfIMSI) These weren't rich multinational corporation owners, these were simple gallery shop owners in a mall trying to support their families.

* [Chavez claims "The land is not private property anymore, land is now social property".](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykkymqImWYA)

* [Chavez expropriates rice production plants.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ez5fDdHujGg)

* [Chavez expropriates a section of "Polar", the biggest processor plant of food and drinks of Venezuela.](https://es.reuters.com/article/idESMAE63R0VQ20100428)

* [Chavez expropriates Market chain store "Exito".](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGZ994taTSg)

To those that STILL doubt that wasn't socialism, these 2 events are proof that it was:

* [Chavez calls to threaten bank president on Live TV: *"If the bank is not for sale, i can expropiate it immediately if i want to"* if the bank doesn't want to give hypothecary loans.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFOJzqEwFwg)

* [Venezuelan government closes 8 banks in 11 days.](https://www.elmundo.es/america/2009/12/12/noticias/1260592457.html)

* [Chavez calls to expropriate "rich families" to finance the city and other government facilities.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Lmri4HOO6U)

Taking stuff from "the bourgeois" to give to the people, it doesn't get more socialist than that. Chavez was a big fan of take over what wasn't his and tell "fuck you" to the real owners.

This should be enough evidence it was socialism in action.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

#**Core services seized for the revolution:**

On 2007, [the government adquired "Electricidad de Caracas", the biggest electricity company](https://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2007/02/09/internacional/1170979956.html) in Venezuela.

Actually, the government took possesion of [10 electrical companies](https://www.emol.com/noticias/internacional/2007/02/01/244426/hugo-chavez-anuncia-que-nacionalizara-10-empresas-electricas.html) from the private sector.

It didn't took much time for the electrical sector to be in crisis after being under socialist management. [In 2009, Venezuela was in a big energy crisis with constant energy outages.](https://www.bbc.com/mundo/economia/2009/10/091021_0207_venezuela_sin_energia_gm)

**How constant they were?**

[We are talking of 6 massive power outages in the last 2 years (2007-2009)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrNmLj2vMGQ)

**How big they were?**

Notably, [in 2008, a power outage left 60% of Venezuela without electricity.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NSMExRvLQs)

And like that, [power outages continued into 2011](https://www.elmundo.es/america/2011/06/12/venezuela/1307889437.html) until the current year.

The situation of more than 10 years ago has only gotten worse.

On this year,  [Venezuela was without electricity for MORE THAN SIX ENTIRE DAYS.](https://www.bbc.com/mundo/noticias-america-latina-47545405)

Imagine that.

144 hours.  
Without electricity.  

How were hospitals and clinics during this time? [Doctors tried to help patients, specially one that needed an air machine, but without electricity there wasn't much they could do.](https://www.bbc.com/mundo/noticias-america-latina-47511975)

Each and every power outage is always blamed by the socialist government on the bourgeois or someone else, it's never their fault, [even when experts constantly warned on 2010 that the electrical sector was at the border of collapse due to lack of proper management ](https://www.elnuevoherald.com/noticias/mundo/america-latina/article2003051.html)

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

#**The war of the socialist revolution against the free press.**

A socialist regime always ends repressing the free press, and Venezuela was not going to be the exception.

* [Venezuela government threatens CNN and Globovision - 2007](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_SXD-WuIYc)
* [Venezuela government threatens the free press - 2008.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYAEFa9YIaY)
* [Venezuela government threatens the free press - 2009.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3CrsFoPmng)
* [Venezuela government threatens the free press - 2009 (2)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iq1Ib3Tj47w)
* [Venezuela government threatens the free press for not praising his regime. - 2012](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X28UrUC3ptE)
* [Chavez says "i should have closed all the media!"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBFTeK4F6iI)

I could be all day showing this, but let's go to the part where the revolution actually acts on their threats.

#**Socialization of the Venezuela's alimentary industries led to their failure:**

Many claim it was only the oil to blame for Venezuela's problems. 

This is a lie.

Chavez and Maduro's *"Bolivarian socialist revolution of the XXI century"* made an effort to destroy Venezuela's once prosperous industry.

The expropriation of businesses of the food industry [lead to the alimentary crisis in venezuela](https://www.libremercado.com/2015-08-15/las-expropiaciones-chavistas-llevaron-el-hambre-a-venezuela-1276554736/), this is a well-known fact for experts and everyone that follows Venezuela situation.

The expropriation had an explicit socialist goal, as it was proudly announced things like [bakery companies being seized and given "to the people"](https://www.elmundo.es/internacional/2017/03/16/58cac30322601d18308b4594.html).

It is often said *"Venezuela is not socialism because 70% of the industry is private!!"* by pro-Chavez/pro-Maduro people, [but the information comes from the central bank of Venezuela. They claim the state ownership is the same as before Chavez took power in 1998](https://www.foxnews.com/world/what-socialism-private-sector-still-dominates-venezuelan-economy-despite-chavez-crusade)...anyone can realize that's a BIG lie after reading this post and seeing how many businesses were seized since 1998. 

In reality **[Chavez expropiated over 1,200 companies in just 10 years, and that without count Maduro's expropriations.](https://www.eleconomista.com.mx/empresas/Hugo-Chavez-expropio-casi-1200-empresas-en-diez-anos-20130307-0045.html) So the *"70% is owned by the private sector"* number of 1998 when Chavez started his government does not apply anymore on 2019.**

And [of that number, the socialist government led to collapse over 1,000 seized businesses.](http://www.el-nacional.com/noticias/economia/gobierno-llevo-colapso-mas-1000-empresas-expropiadas-anos_247729)


######**The crisis in the vegetable and agricultural industry caused by socialism:**

On 2009, he seized part of the rice industry, staple food for the venezuelan people, [from foreign and national private investments](https://elpais.com/internacional/2009/03/05/actualidad/1236207605_850215.html) for the glory of the bolivarian socialist economic model.

Then the government proceeded to embark on a quest to seize all fertilizer businesses they could, [among them the companies Agroisleña,  KOMSA, Peviquen and Fetrinitro](https://www.iisd.org/itn/es/2018/04/24/venezuela-held-liable-unlawful-expropriation-fertilizer-plants-claudia-arietti/), the biggest distributers of fertilizers in the entire country, diminishing the private investment in the country.

Speaking of Agroisleña, when the socialist government expropriated "Agroisleña", [an agricultural supplier of seeds, manure, fertilizers and etc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5FVek2ty8c) in 2010, they proceeded [to rename it to "Agropatria" to put emphasis it was socialized and popular property.](https://www.elmundo.es/america/2010/10/10/venezuela/1286727014.html) 

The new "popular-owned" Agropatria [socialism management catastrophically failed, which lead to an increase in 700% in the price of products like **rice**.](https://www.elmundo.es/america/2010/10/10/venezuela/1286727014.html)

And just like socialist ideologues propose, [Venezuelan government made a law of "lazy lands", which gave the government the right to expropriate fields and lands they arbitrarily considered were not producing as much as the government wanted, for the benefit of the rural population and the glory of the revolution.](https://www.eltiempo.com/archivo/documento/MAM-477975)

Experts claim **[the socialization of the a key agricultural business is what started the food crisis in Venezuela](https://web.archive.org/web/20160804111157/http://elvenezolanonews.com/regimen-desastre-agroislena/)**, still, that didn't stopped Maduro from keep doing the exact same thing [by expropriating ANOTHER fertilizer company.](https://www.iisd.org/itn/es/2018/04/24/venezuela-held-liable-unlawful-expropriation-fertilizer-plants-claudia-arietti/)

######**The crisis in the meat and dairy industry caused by the socialist revolution:**

Among many, MANY cattle and dairy businesses, [Chavez called to expropriate the "Compañia Inglesa" land, a British-owned cattle ranch of over 290,000 hectares for the people.](http://www.abc.com.py/edicion-impresa/internacionales/chavez-ordena-expropiar-tierra-que-pertenece-a-una-compania-inglesa-326928.html) In fact, over [3,600,000 hectares of cattle-farming land have been seized](http://www.fao.org/in-action/agronoticias/detail/es/c/508828/) as of 2011, the number is probably much much bigger as of 2018.

The result of the [socialist management of these cattle ranch and expropriation of cattle](https://www.eleconomistaamerica.com/politica-eAm/noticias/9516714/11/18/Ganaderos-de-Venezuela-denuncian-expropiaciones-de-reses-por-gobiernos-locales.html) caused [a massive crisis in the production of these meat and dairty goods](https://www.elimpulso.com/2018/12/06/la-ganaderia-de-venezuela-en-crisis-sin-incentivos-ni-insumos-y-ahora-con-21-mataderos-expropiados-6dic/), which lead to **[an increment of 700%~900% in the price of milk and meat](http://www.eluniversal.com/economia/25223/invelecar-el-incremento-del-precio-de-la-carne-al-consumidor-ronda-entre-700-y-900)**

######**The crisis in the fish, seafood and sea industry caused by the socialist revolution:**

Following the trend of the agro-industry, [Chavez ordered the army the expropriation of ports and fishing fleet to socialize them, also giving the order of "send to Jail whoever disagrees!"](https://www.abc.es/hemeroteca/historico-15-03-2009/abc/Internacional/chavez-ordena-la-toma-de-los-puertos-y-expropia-la-flota-pesquera_913793566158.html) and once again, the socialization [lead to the collapse of fishing fleets and the paralyzation of the production.](https://web.archive.org/web/20170224200457/https://elpitazo.com/oriente/dos-empresas-pesqueras-gubernamentales-estan-paralizadas-falta-insumos-sucre/)

Not only that, [300 ships, 29 towing ships, 25 piers and 5 
shipyards were seized](http://www1.rfi.fr/actues/articles/113/article_11841.asp) for the glory of the socialist revolution too.

&nbsp;

#**Socialism implementation destroyed the industry:**

Not only the core alimentary sectors were affected, the overall industry in Venezuela suffered because of the socialist revolution.

The revolutionary government wanted to take over the entire cement business from the private sector, [obtaining the swiss Holcim](https://www.swissinfo.ch/spa/economia/en-marcha--la-nacionalizaci%C3%B3n-de-holcim-venezuela/6593082), the french [cement Lafarge](https://elpais.com/diario/2008/04/05/internacional/1207346407_850215.html) and when [unable to reach a deal to buy Cemex, a mexican productor of cement, simply expropriates it](https://www.20minutos.es/noticia/406329/0/venezuela/expropia/cemex/). 

After that, the socialization [lead to the industry to reach red numbers, producing 41% LESS than what they did before they were expropriated.](https://transparencia.org.ve/project/las-cifras-rojas-la-industria-cementera-manos-del-estado-venezolano/) This has lead to **[a raise of 400% in the price of cement](https://maduradas.com/descomunal-gobierno-autoriza-aumento-del-400-en-el-precio-del-cemento/)** in the country.

The government seized businesses randomly and explicitly for the revolution. 

[In 2010, Venezuelan government seized glass-container maker private company Owens-Illinois. The reason? In words of chavez: "Revolution and more revolution!"](https://www.americaeconomia.com/negocios-industrias/fusiones-adquisiciones/chavez-expropia-fabricante-de-envases-de-vidrio-estadouni)

The mining business was also not forgotten by the revolution, [The government seized private mining business on the south of venezuela,](https://www.nacion.com/economia/venezuela-toma-control-de-concesion-minera-de-gold-reserve/WR5D562Q6ZGEFBFFA62QPYOZ2Y/story/) which like the rest of businesses taken away [failed spectacularly, putting ANOTHER of venezuela's industry on crisis.](https://www.aporrea.org/actualidad/a196949.html)

The bolivarian socialist government also ordered [the nationalization of metallurgic industry](https://elpais.com/internacional/2009/05/22/actualidad/1242943207_850215.html) and even more importantly [the expropiation of the "Sidor" metallurgy in Venezuela](https://www.elterritorio.com.ar/hugo-chavez-decreto-la-expropiacion-de-sidor-4180654384290688-et) one of the key industries of the country. 

Once again, after the socialization [the metallurgy industry was put in crisis](https://www.bbc.com/mundo/noticias/2014/08/140723_venezuela_sidor_chavez_dp) to the point that what once was a vibrant steel factory is now a ghost town. 

With this kind of industry destruction, it is not surprise [the production of steel in venezuela is in crisis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1qSUosfOLk).

######**Plenty of foreign companies had to leave venezuela because of the socialist bolivarian revolution makes impossible for them to keep producing goods:**

Be because they simply cannot keep producing goods, they don't have the necessary ingredients or simply the government keeps meddling with controls, multiple foreign business simply had to leave Venezuela.

&nbsp;

#**The oil industry:**

Chavez regime took over the oil industry and it lead to it's collapse.

In 2007, [chavez took over the orinoco oil projects estimated in 30 BILLION dollars](https://elpais.com/diario/2007/07/01/economia/1183240802_850215.html) driving away a lot of foreign investment from France, Norway, etc. Chavez was effectively gaining control of the oil in Venezuela, as part of the socialist revolution.

And, of course, he drove it to the ground with exorbitant socialists taxes in 2008, [oil taxes up to 60%, making things harder for what was remaining of the private investment in venezuela's oil industry.](https://expansion.mx/negocios/2008/04/15/venezuela-aprueba-impuesto-a-petroleo)

The next year, on 2009, Chavez regime gets even more desperate as socialism policies fail, [so the government seizes another oil company from what he called "bourgeois owners"](https://www.elnuevoherald.com/noticias/mundo/america-latina/venezuela-es/article1995350.html) for the glory of the revolution. 

Not having enough, on 2010 [Venezuela's regime seized 11 oil rigs](https://www.larazon.es/historico/7126-chavez-expropia-once-torres-petroleras-a-una-compania-estadounidense-OLLA_RAZON_284008) from a foreign company.

And there is more...

* [Chavez expropiates oil goods and services in Venezuela.](https://www.nacion.com/el-mundo/chavez-expropia-bienes-y-servicios-petroleros-en-el-oeste-de-venezuela/WBKLU6RPCBDXDPWYDV52L2OIIU/story/)

* [Chavez continues nationalization of oil industry](http://www.rtve.es/noticias/20090508/chavez-continua-nacionalizacion-industria-petrolera/276012.shtml)

* [Chavez expropiates oil fields to "give power to the people".](https://www.infobae.com/2007/05/02/314303-chavez-expropia-campos-petroleo-nacionalizar/)

* [Venezuela takes control of oil fields of the Orinoco](https://www.lavanguardia.com/internacional/20070501/51339614295/el-gobierno-venezolano-toma-el-control-operativo-de-los-campos-petroleros-del-orinoco.html)

I could be all day mentioning how many companies Chavez expropriated  for the glory of socialism.

**[Up to 2009, Chavez revolution expropriated 76 oil companies.](https://www.elespectador.com/economia/articulo141754-chavez-elevo-76-empresas-de-servicios-petroleros-expropiadas)**

76\.  
Oil.  
Companies.  
Expropiated.    

All this socialism surely would work well, right? 

**WRONG.**

######**What was the result of all that expropriation?**

* Lack of funds.
* Lack of payments.
* Lack of workers.
* Lack of maintenance.
* Lack of production.

Why? Because [Chavez knew literally nothing of the business and mismanaged it.](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/07/16/how-venezuela-struck-it-poor-oil-energy-chavez/)

[Expropriations leads the PDVSA to the border of bankrupt.](https://www.libremercado.com/2018-05-12/las-expropiaciones-de-chavez-pasan-factura-a-pdvsa-que-esta-al-borde-de-la-quiebra-1276618585/)

[The collapse of the PDVSA  (Venezuelan state-owned oil and natural gas company) after the Bolivarian socialist revolution.](https://www.infobae.com/def/internacionales/2018/08/25/la-otra-cara-de-la-crisis-en-venezuela-el-colapso-de-pdvsa/)

The situation is so ridiculous but the socialist revolution is stubborn, Maduro claimed he wanted an even [more socialist PDVSA and ordered more production.](https://www.efe.com/efe/america/economia/maduro-dice-quiere-una-pdvsa-socialista-y-pide-repunte-de-la-produccion/20000011-3626985) and in the following months [the military took control of the estate PDVSA](https://www.voanoticias.com/a/venezuela-mando-militar-sume-a-pdvsa-en-su-peor-crisis-en-decadas/4716619.html).

&nbsp;

#**The price-control of the socialist revolution make the problem even worse:**

The state controls the distribution of goods with socialism, and Chavez/Maduro regime is no exception. Their regime is known to impose price controls to the goods the people desperately want, which leads to more shortages.

[Venezuelan Price Controls](https://mises.org/wire/price-controls-are-disastrous-venezuela-and-everywhere-else) which Lead to [Predictable Shortages](https://www.nacion.com/economia/chavez-anuncia-control-de-precios-en-venezuela/CD652WMW2RFZZHYBIYJTQDNA3U/story/). According to a recent survey, [60% of Venezuelans](https://www.elmundo.es/economia/macroeconomia/2018/08/29/5b859a48e5fdeaf73b8b45d9.html) shed at least 11 kilograms in weight during the last year due to malnutrition because of the shortages and overall lack of availability of food. 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

It took me quite a while to make this post, **but in conclusion:**

Claim Venezuela's problems are not because of Maduro and Chavez *"Socialism Bolivarian Revolution"* is being willfully ignorant at best, and completely evil if still believe so after reading this. 

**Chavez and Maduro meticulously focused in fuck pretty much all of Venezuela's once prosperous industries by taking the private property away, threatening people on live TV and even ordering to jail whoever opposed, all for their** ***"Socialism Bolivarian Revolution"*** **, which lead to the current situation.**

>Trump then creates another Congress, filled with his own supporters, to pass laws. When there are street protests against this, he sends out National Guard to crack down. More than 100 are killed by security forces. Thousands arbitrarily arrested. Top democratic leaders are arrested or forced into exile. Some are tortured.

>Trump then heads for re-election. But his administration bars any top Democrat from running. The Democrats boycott the election. Trump holds it anyway and wins! No credible observers are allowed. Even the guy who set up the electronic voting system says there’s fraud.

>Trump is sworn in by his fake congress. The real Congress, meanwhile, says he’s an illegitimate president. And, according to law, they swear in the head of Congress as the legitimate president until new elections can be held. That interim president is recognized by many nations.

>Now, is that a coup by the real Congress? Or has the coup already taken place by the president? In a nutshell, that’s what happened in Venezuela.

Chavez, su cupula, todos deben caer, afecten  desde lo mas bajo sus esbirros, limitenles todo, ni agua a esas personas, los que estan en pie de lucha difundan todo lo que tienen que los militares, pnb sepan con quien deben estar que sepan que estan de lado equivocado.

Los que no puedan ayudenles con lo que puedan.

MUERTE A LA TIRANIA.

These are some sources that they gave us, distribute them and may the tyrant never go unpunished, there are no more opportunities, enough of them screwing us, they killed many of our acquaintances yesterday, we are more than those who stole our freedom from many of us on December 2, 1998.

Chavez, his leadership, everyone must fall, affect from the lowest your henchmen, limit everything, those who are standing up to fight, spread everything you have.

Those who cannot help them with what you can

I repeat, DO NOT FALL INTO PESSIMISM, WE ARE MORE THAN THOSE TYRANTS,

************Surrealismo Criollo 4.5 [Crédito: Toledo’s Art] 


************Vayan a votar Señores, intentaré apelar a la socavada capacidad de raciocinio que le queda al Venezolano promedio después de tantos golpes: 

Si fuese tan fácil para el Chavismo robarse las elecciones y dar el resultado que les venga en gana teniendo una oposición activa con testigos y colaboradores en cada centro de votación, entonces ni siquiera se habrían tomado la molestia de inhabilitar a María Corina Machado y a medio país, tampoco habrían neutralizado a la inmensa mayoría de los Venezolanos en el exterior para que no puedan votar, y estarían de lo más tranquilos haciendo campaña sin esforzarse mucho, y haciendo el teatro de "somos ejemplo de una fuerza política democrática y pacífica" para que la comunidad internacional los deje en paz, sin ventajismo electoral alguno para cumplir con todo lo acordado, pero vemos que NO ES ASÍ.

El Chavismo HA PERDIDO ELECCIONES, y solo ha manipulado resultados a sus anchas cuando compiten ellos solos y no hay ciudadanía opositora en los centros de votación (si hasta Smartmatic tuvo que denunciar irregularidades y salir del país cuando el CNE infló sus cifras), también pueden jugar con los "grises" y hacer "fraudes hormiga" para remontar diferencias "cabeza a cabeza" como en las elecciones de Capriles Vs Maduro, pero está demostrado que NO PUEDEN manipular resultados en los que la brecha es superior al 10%, y en este caso es la primera vez que la brecha seguramente será MAYOR en una elección presidencial, pero para que eso se haga realidad, es necesario que se registre una ALTA PARTICIPACIÓN.

El Chavismo va a aprovechar cada oportunidad para aferrarse al poder, y ahí veremos, pero el NO VOTAR, si tienes la posibilidad de hacerlo, cuando el Chavismo CLARAMENTE QUIERE QUE LA OPOSICIÓN SE ABSTENGA, es colaborar directamente con Maduro. Ya sabemos lo que el Chavismo tiene para "ofrecerle" al país, en más de un cuarto de siglo queda más que claro que mientras gobiernen, en Venezuela no se podrá acceder a indicadores de Desarrollo Humano medianamente decentes, y que estemos donde estemos en el mundo, llevaremos encima el estigma de la miseria, la pobreza, la crisis y la decadencia, irremediablemente asociado a nuestra nacionalidad.

Si alguien que dice no estar de acuerdo con el Chavismo encuentra más satisfacción en la idea del fracaso de la oposición para poder decir "se los dije" (en medio de una tragedia nacional que nos llevaría mínimo a 6 años más de Chavismo y a un nuevo éxodo), que en contemplar una posibilidad de transición política con la salida del Chavismo del poder, entonces esa persona de verdad tiene que sentarse a reflexionar profundamente y sincerarse sobre su enfoque y sus convicciones.

VAYAN A VOTAR

************24 hours without electricity, water. Local media reports about the nation-wide blackout are almost inexistent. Russian troops entered the country two days ago It's very worrying the uncertainity about our situation here in Barquisimeto. The number of civil casualties at hands of Maduro's backed death squads will surely rise taking advantage of night darkness, but only moon's light.

The regime has already stated the desire to persecute and kill civilians that they have blamed for today's blackout.

Internet connection is inestable and almost nothing is coming out of the country. 

We used to be the most prosperous and progressive in the region, and also we used to enjoy a very safe country. Right now you get killed in the streets by criminal gangs wearing police  uniforms who would also kidnap you without any hesitation. Terrorists groups operate along with military units to slaughter from african descendants venezuelans and indigenous groups in the jungle to gain control over gold mines. 

Russian regime has been pushing for a prolonged suffering of the venezuelan people, by throwing financial lifelines to the venezuelan regime, by investing on gold-related join ventures created illegaly under shaddy terms that does  not benefit  the  venezuelan people but only a few who are in the inner circle of the regime. Russian troops are said to continue the silent genocide of our indigenous groups.

Here in Barquisimeto our worries are coming from insecurity and our inhability to supply ourselves with food and drinkable water. The insecurity is not about getting shot during a gang-related shooting but instead, it's a about getting shot in the bus stop by thugs in motorcycles who commonly belong to colectivo groups. Our fear comes from getting your house broken up by thugs and get killed to steal your belongings. 

More worries comes from our inhability to find potable water which left us to seek water from irregular sources not treated for human consumption. 

This is a nightmare. The amount of people that are being drove into our deaths is by the millions. This war the socialist regime unleashed against disarmed civilians is among one of the worst human-related crimes. It all started once the regime dismantled our private property rights, back in 2001 by enacting laws based on socialist principles. 

I thanks every foreigner who has been paying attention to our struggle in restoring democracy and supporting us by creating awareness about the humanitarian crisis. All governments around the World who have sided with the venezuelan people. 

I wish this could be solved by peaceful means. But I understand that sometimes it needs a small push from allied agents to promote the outcome the entire country deserve, a democratically elected president.

The humanitarian crisis and problems like blackout would surely be solved if competent people were in government.

************Enserio, que asco me dan los zurdos de otros paises cuando se trata de esta situación. Esto es algo que veo a menudo en redes sociales, en especial los españoles izquierdosos del psoe, y los argentinos kirchneristas.

Este es un tipo de mala leche que se le tiene al venezolano muy distinto al de otros paises, y es el odio por "facho". Este tipo de gente quiere hacer de menos al venezolano y no tomar en serio nuestra situación simplemente porque muchos de nosotros no tenemos las mismas inclinaciones politicas, y rechazamos este gobierno, al que ellos no creen que es malo por el simple hecho de ser de izquierda ( y no haber vivido bajo el mismo)

Los españoles zurdos nos dicen fachos, clasistas, homofobos, que le lamemos las botas a EEUU y nos viven relacionando con los ricos del barrio Salamanca de Madrid. Mientras que los argentinos kirchneristas nos dicen lo mismo y a su vez nos quieren echar la culpa de que Milei sea el presidente.

Ya ni hablemos de los gringos, o mas bien los zurdos angloparlantes que estan obsesionados con las razas y nos llaman racistas colonizadores por tumbar estatuas de indios 😭




************Ya voté, y le saqué el Instagram a una chama ¿Qué procede? No tengo más batería social, pero casualmente vive cerca de donde yo, así que pensé en escribirle al rato, ¿Algún consejo?


************¿Qué piensan de esto? (es de un tweet que de volvió viral) 


************Buenas tardes! 


************[AMA] Venezolano de 102 años que ha vivido en Venezuela desde la epoca del Presidente Victorino Márquez Disculpen la tardanza, entre poder comunicarme con mi abuelo, Francisco Rodriguez, y obtener pruebas para hacer ese AMA oficial, me ha tomado un tiempo. En el "Pre-AMA" muchos de ustedes hicieron preguntas para mi abuelo, aqui estan las respuestas.

(Nuevas preguntas son mas que bienvenidas. La verdad estuvo muy feliz cuando le conte sobre el interes de tantas personas en el Internet.- De ante mano me disculpo por cualquier error ortografico. Escribo mientras escucho la grabacion de nuestra conversacion). 


/u/conqher: "¿Recuerda que géneros musicales eran calificados como demasiado explícitos y luego se volvieron normales?, ¿Cual es el momento mas icono que le toco vivir?, ¿Que consejos le daria a su yo de 20 - 30 - 40 años?."

Francisco: 

Generos musicales: "La verdad no recuerdo, en aquel tiempo habian pocos compositores y la musica que escuchabamos venian muchas veces de otros paises."

Momento Iconico: "El mas iconico en mi vida; a los 7 anos me eche a trabajar. Esos jamas se me olvido, nunca. A los 7 anos yo me fui a trabajar para ayudar a darle de comer a mis hermanos y a mis padres. En aquel tiempo lo que ganaba papa en aquel tiempo, no alcanzaba nojoda ni pa una semana de comida. Aveces salia a vender empanadas o a vender bollos en la calle. A buscar a Dios. Me recuerdo como el primer dia."

¿Que consejos le daria a su yo de 20 - 30 - 40 años?: Empezando la vida a los 30 anos, yo le aconsejaria si quiere llevar una vida... yo le aconsejaria que antes de los 30 anos se case o busque novia, porque lo mas grande que puede tener uno despues de esa edad es tener hijos. Con eso te lo digo todo. 

/u/somehowhuman pregunta: Para una persona que ha vivido el avance tecnológico durante casi un siglo, qué relevancia le da a la tecnología? Considera que aporto cambios positivos o negativos a la sociedad?

Francisco: "El telefono. Jamas en la vida pensamos que ibamos a poder comunicarnos con Estados Unidos como estamos haciendo ahora mismo, u otros paises. Nunca en la vida. Hay que pensar que eso es un invento muy bueno que hicieron."

/u/AlexDKZ pregunta: Tu abuelo tenia unos 21 años cuando estalló la WWII. ¿Que recuerda de la misma?

Francisco: "Si me acuerdo. Comence yo a trabajar en la destileria en Maracaibo, con unos franceses que venian derrotados de la guerra."

(El ha hablado ya de este tema, pero no hablo mucho esta vez. Recuerdo que ha mencionado muchas veces que lo mas que ellos sintieron fueron algunas noticias en los periodicos, y algunos barcos americanos estacionados en el Lago o en la costa). 

/u/ppmch pregunta: Cómo sintió la migración durante el siglo pasado? Qué decían los venezolanos de los italianos? Españoles? Colombianos? Sentían que les quitaban el trabajo? Cómo eran vistos en general?

Francisco: "Bueno, Venezuela en aquel tiempo era un pais muy humilde. Los recibiamos muy bien porque nos venian a ensenar, los que no sabiamos, y a trabajar. El Venezolano es muy trabajador, y dispuesto a aprender, ahora es que hay mucho sin verguenza y ha cambiado la cosa."

/u/DramaticFilm: Ud. orgulloso de ser venezolano? Porque?

Francisco: "Como no voy a sentirme orgulloso de Venezuela, Dios me ha dado toda la vida que tengo en este pais. Para mi no hay otro pais como Venezuela, porque aqui vi nacer a mis hijos, aqui vi amigos y familiares luchar por seguir adelante. Yo solo me iria de aqui por mi Familia, pero a este pais lo quiero mucho. 

(/u/Arnaz87 recuerdo que mostraste interes por esta pregunta)

/u/bighotcarrot pregunta: Consejos de salud de todo tipo?

Francisco: "Ante todo trabajar. Buena alimentacion, no derrocharse, no exagerar. Alimentarse bien para trabajar y sobrevivir. No como enlatados ni sodas, mas que todo jugos y cosas naturales que yo mismo puedo hacer en la casa."

/u/Radinax tuvo muchas preguntas, pero la que le pregunte fue: Siguiendo con el tema de arriba, que opina el sobre que la mujer debe obedecer a su marido y respetarlo?

Francisco: "La mujer hoy en dia es muy fuerte, tiene mucho valor, porque le hemos dado mucha libertad a las mujeres. Se les ha dado libertad, y no estoy seguro de que este tan bien. Muchas veces las mujeres desobecen al esposo y se dan muchos divorcios. 

Me gusta que tengan la libertad, pero tienen que ayudar al hombre, a la familia, si es necesario trabajar, que trabaje. Si se muere el marido, y ella no trabaja, entonces la familia sufre mucho mas."

"Pero si, deben obedecer siempre y cuando no se les pida algo sin sentido". 

(Solo para dejar algo en claro, me sorprendio un poco su respuesta porque la que tiene los pantalones en la familia es mi abuela, quien fue la Directora de la carcel de mujeres de Maracaibo, y tiene mucho mas caracter que el jaja). 

Crees en Dios? "Si claro".

/u/wheresmyink pregunta: Recuerda la época de Juan Vicente Gómez?

Francisco: En aquel tiempo cuando Gomez, no habia ni estudio ni un cono. No habia colegio ni nada. Para poder iluminar al pueblo Venezolano tenia que haber ESTUDIO. Ese era el dicho de el, de Gomez. 

Que opina de haberse llamado Estados Unidos de Venezuela?

Francisco: "Me gustaba, pero no me molesta ningun nombre, Venezuela es Venezuela."

/u/drchlt pregunta: Pregúntale sobre la división nacional-cosmopolita venezolana, e.g. whisky vs. ron, beisbol vs. fútbol, etc.

Francisco: Whisky y beisbol. En cuanto a musica, la gaita. 

/u/hector_villalobos pregunta: Me gustaría que describiera a Venezuela en su infancia, que recuerda y como era el estilo de vida de aquella época.

Francisco: Desde joven me hechaba los palitos, pero con mucho juicio. En esos pueblos era muy normal para la gente jovencita irse pa las putas desde los 13 anos o antes. Yo no te puedo mentir, pero siempre tuve cuidado. En esa epoca era muy normal, ahora es muy mal visto, y con razon. 

(/u/the01crow su hobby eran las mujeres y beber aparentemente jaja, me han contado que era muy tremendo de joven, y siempre ha sido mujeriago, pero en matrimonio fue muy serio.... Si no mi abuela lo jodia jaja). 

/u/jesuskater pregunta: Consejos en el ambiente laboral.

Francisco: "Que sea responsable en su trabajo. Que sea muy responsable, si no tiene responsabilidad en su trabajo es un fracasado."


/u/Arnaz87 pregunta: ¿Cuál ha sido el periodo más estable y más próspero para él?

Francisco: "Yo te diria que a pesar de que fue un dictador, me quedaria con Perez Jimenez, le dio vida a este pais."

Momento mas prospero: "Del 45 al 80, por ahi, y de mi fruto, de lo que yo producia". 

/u/Hoozuki_Suigetsu pregunta: Para esa edad habra visto morir a muchos amigos y familiares, como afrontar esa situación?

Francisco: Perder un ser querido es muy duro, eso no se puede describir, eso se siente, y no se deja de sentir. 

Pregunta: Cual fue el primer gran cambio tecnologico que le hizo pensar que el mundo estaba avanzando y como lo vivio? 

Francisco: "El internet, el telefono, fax, todo ha sido importante y ha cambiado el mundo. Pero el telefono. Ha sido lo que ha cambiado al mundo."

/r/sgtpepe (yo): Que estas comiendo ahora? 

Abuelo: Una arepita.. si quereis te venis a comerte una conmigo!

-----------------------------------------------------

Muchas gracias a todos por sus preguntas. Les manda saludos y aprecio mucho el momento! Si tienen alguna pregunta, sientanse libres de preguntar aqui mismo. Intentare llamarlo en los proximos dias para que me responda! 

Saludos a todos.


Edit: Olvide escribir esto. Alguien pregunto cual ha sido el peor presidente y epoca de la historia del pais (desde los años 20). Dijo que el peor presidente que ha tenido Venezuela ha sido Nicolas Maduro. 

El abuelo salio a la primera marcha de Guaido. El Abuelo fue a votar a TODAS las elecciones. Camina en las marchas, asi sean 15 minutos. Mucha gente lo sigue y lo cuida por su edad, pero ahi siempre esta. Su amor por Venezuela y su familia es lo que mas admiro de el.

************El caso Venezuela: Desmintiendo algunos mitos de la situación Hago el post con la finalidad de tener un espacio conveniente para las respuestas de algunos mitos sobre Venezuela y la crisis actual.



**#1 Venezuela está mal por los bajos precios del petróleo**

Un mito tan inocente, que hasta algunos venezolanos se lo creen, pero aún así es **falso**. Venezuela ha sido dependiente del petróleo en buena parte de su historia, y resulta extraño que sea ahora que una bajada "abrupta" haya causado tanto desmadre, en especial cuando el precio del crudo [ha estado más bajo en el pasado](https://www.macrotrends.net/1369/crude-oil-price-history-chart) de lo que está hoy en día. Es más, Venezuela no es el único país que depende enteramente de la exportación del crudo. Países como Irak y Arabia Saudita [son igual o hasta más dependientes del crudo](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/05/which-economies-are-most-reliant-on-oil/), y aún así la bajada no les ha afectado en comparación. Eso sin mencionar que a ellos les [conviene producir más, que a la larga disminuye el precio](https://www.eleconomista.es/materias-primas/noticias/9226954/06/18/La-OPEP-llega-a-un-acuerdo-para-aumentar-la-produccion-en-unos-600000-barriles.html).

Tampoco tiene sentido que el precio del petróleo suba y Venezuela esté cada vez peor. Tampoco tiene sentido en que la bajada del petróleo haya causado que el gobierno maldiga y de cacería a la propiedad privada, infrinja numerosos derechos humanos, haya dado soporte al terrorismo...  Y muchas otras cosas que la gente que cree este mito no toma en cuenta.

En fin, el cuento es un sin-sentido por donde se vea, y muchas cosas no se explican solo con el oro negro. Quizás esto último no tenga sentido para usted porque de seguro cree en el siguiente mito, que lo discutiré a continuación.



**#2 El problema de Venezuela es solo económico**

Este mito surge más que nada con los venezolanos, irónicamente, que los únicos resultados tangibles de la crisis que ellos perciben [son los precios y la devaluación del Bolívar](https://www.elperiodico.com/es/internacional/20180920/trabajadores-venezolanos-protesta-medidas-salariales-7043926), moneda nacional. Tampoco hay que dejar atrás a los extranjeros, que solo ven inmigrantes aquí y allá. Aquí también entran quienes creen que con quitar el control cambiario y dar libertad a las importaciones, ya se arregla todo. Pero tendría sentido si la economía fuese el único problema, o mejor dicho, que todo el espectro de caos que vemos hoy en día es por consecuencias económicas.

Cuando les dices sobre la política que está dominada por [politicastros y sin ninguna posibilidad de recuperación](https://es.panampost.com/panam-staff/2018/01/25/editorial-en-venezuela-existen-dos-oposiciones-una-verdadera-y-una-complice/), lo ven como un añadido. Cuando les dices de la [crisis sanitaria](http://efectococuyo.com/principales/venezuela-vive-crisis-sanitaria-devastadora-advierte-human-rights-watch/), ni le paran pelota hasta que les da gripe. Y cuando les dices sobre el [ELN](http://www.el-nacional.com/noticias/sociedad/eln-expande-para-controlar-minas-pasos-fronterizos-venezuela_258867), los [múltiples casos de narcotráfico por parte del gobierno](https://www.infobae.com/america/venezuela/2018/05/31/como-venezuela-se-convirtio-en-el-refugio-del-narcotrafico-y-el-contrabando-colombiano/), [violaciones de DDHH](https://www.ohchr.org/SP/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=22007&LangID=S), [Hezbolá](https://www.businessinsider.com/new-venezuela-vice-president-has-ties-to-iran-hezbollah-2017-1) y demás, ellos como que le dan la vuelta. Le buscan a cuarta pata al gato para ver como meten toda esa información en su cosmovisión limitada.

No hay manera sutil de decir esto, pero el caso de Venezuela no es ni económico ni político, es un problema **criminal**. Como si Pablo Escobar y su pandilla se hubiesen hecho con el poder del Estado. Y tal como hizo Pablo Escobar, busca [diálogos para ganar tiempo](https://www.elespectador.com/especiales/los-intentos-politicos-de-escobar-negociar-su-guerra-articulo-379288), al mismo ritmo que preparan los siguientes negocios porque la fiesta tiene que seguir. Mírenlos pues, haciendo negocios como los propios profesionales, ¿a que no son cuchis? Eso sin mencionar lo que han dicho [algunos países en el asunto.](https://www.bbc.com/mundo/noticias/2015/03/150309_eeuu_venezuela_sanciones_emergencia_tsb)

**#3 Venezuela está mal por culpa de Nicolás Maduro**

Esta es una verdad a medias. Porque si bien es cierto que Maduro está causando estragos ahora, es falso que todo haya sido de su única responsabilidad. Con solo decir que la economía de una nación [no se jode en **menos de un año**](https://www.bbc.com/mundo/noticias/2013/03/130306_venezuela_chavez_legado_economico_gtg), debería de ser suficiente para ignorar esto, pero siguen y siguen y siguen con la cataleta, hace falta explicar un poco.

* La compra de conciencia no se dio con Maduro.

* El [caso Odebrecht](http://www.el-nacional.com/noticias/politica/odebrecht-financio-ultima-campana-chavez_84893) no empezó con Maduro.

* Los [fraudes políticos, electorales](https://okdiario.com/internacional/2017/08/03/cable-eeuu-advirtio-del-fraude-electoral-desde-que-chavez-encargo-recuento-smartmatic-1210146) y el [soporte a criminales](https://elpais.com/diario/2001/12/02/internacional/1007247601_850215.html) no comenzó con Maduro. 

* La llamada ["boliburguesía"](https://www.bbc.com/mundo/economia/2009/12/091202_1045_venezuela_boliburguesia_wbm) no nació con Maduro. 

* La [destrucción del aparato productivo del país](https://www.libremercado.com/2015-08-15/las-expropiaciones-chavistas-llevaron-el-hambre-a-venezuela-1276554736/) no comenzó con Maduro. 

* La [censura de los medios](https://www.elnuevodiario.com.ni/internacionales/81493-hugo-chavez-impone-censura-prensa/) no comenzó con Maduro. 

* La [destrucción de la autonomía de los entes públicos](https://www.aporrea.org/actualidad/n102281.html) no empezó con Maduro.

* Y al momento de escribir esto, la corrupción de [Raúl Gorrín y Andrade](https://www.bbc.com/mundo/noticias-america-latina-46306751) tampoco comenzó con Maduro. 

Todo esto que mencioné data de mucho antes, y en todos ellos el responsable es el mismo: **Hugo Rafaél Chávez Frías**.

¿Qué mérito tiene Maduro? Aparte de ser un brutazo, seguir con el plan de Chávez, que es empobrecer a la nación y hacer que todos sean dependientes de ellos. No es tanto mérito pero algo es algo.

**#4 La crisis de Venezuela es gracias al Capitalismo. El 70% de la economía es privada**

Este es una de las cosas que me dicen a mí que, por más mierda que sea Fox News, aún tiene público. ¿Fox News? ¿Por qué lo digo? [Porque esa cifra literalmente vino de Fox News](https://www.foxnews.com/world/what-socialism-private-sector-still-dominates-venezuelan-economy-despite-chavez-crusade), "basado" en el Informe Económico del Banco Central en el 2010. Ninguna otra fuente cita ese 70%, y lo más cercano a eso son [otros chavistas](https://www.aporrea.org/actualidad/a16516.html) tratando de [medio-explicar el asunto](http://questiondigital.com/mitos-sobre-la-economia-venezolana/). Nada bueno se puede esperar de "economistas" que [no entienden la base del dinero](http://www.eluniversal.com/politica/17759/jose-guerra-si-los-salarios-de-anclan-al-petro-la-economia-se-dolariza) y creen en la "guerra económica", al igual que no se puede esperar algo de columnas que niegan el impacto de la crisis ( [como este](https://www.thenation.com/article/why-is-venezuela-in-crisis/) ). Pero este no es el único problema con el mito.

Por una parte, el mito supone que el capitalismo causa crisis, [cuando la realidad es lo contrario](https://mises.org/library/myth-failure-capitalism). Solo las perversiones del estado son las que causan este tipo de cosas. Y por otra parte, el Banco Central tiene la peculiaridad de [no decir nada si las cifras no son favorables.](https://www.panorama.com.ve/politicayeconomia/Desde-hace-15-meses-el-BCV-no-difunde-cifras-oficiales-de-la-inflacion-en-Venezuela-20170314-0015.html) ¿Cómo puede ser una fuente creíble? Eso sin mencionar que el Banco Central es otro órgano del gobierno [para fines propagandísticos.](http://www.bcv.org.ve/billetes-y-monedas/criptomonedas/actos-administrativos/whitepaper-del-petro)

Lo cierto es que la cifra real no se sabe, nadie la sabe. Solo se tienen [algunos indicios](http://www.el-nacional.com/noticias/economia/mas-fuerza-laboral-encuentra-sector-informal_89208) que no son para nada favorables. Tanto para el país como para los que se creen este mito. Yo me remito a palabras de Oliveros: La propiedad privada existe (ignorando el hecho que la propiedad privada requiere leyes para que sea como tal), y está muriendo, por no decir que está en fase terminal.

**#5 La crisis de Venezuela es gracias a las sanciones impuestas por EEUU y países afines**

Las sanciones comenzaron [a mediados del 2014](https://es.panampost.com/adam-dubove/2014/05/12/sanciones-economicas-al-gobierno-de-venezuela-un-remedio-peor-que-la-enfermedad/) y las sanciones más severas no se dieron [sino hasta el presente año](https://ve.usembassy.gov/es/sanciones-del-departamento-del-tesoro/), 2018, **ya cuando el país estaba en crisis**. No es tan difícil de entender, pero vamos a profundizar.

Las sanciones son contra [individuos muy específicos](https://www.notilogia.com/2014/05/lista-de-funcionarios-venezolanos-sancionados-por-estados-unidos.html), que tienen poco o nada que ver con la población general o incluso con la economía. En ningún momento se prohibió la entrada a todos los venezolanos a territorio estadounidense, y en ningún momento se le prohibió a las empresas estadounidenses negociar con los venezolanos. Nada de eso ocurrió porque sencillamente [las sanciones son de carácter político](http://www.el-nacional.com/noticias/politica/estados-unidos-podria-levantar-las-sanciones-contra-gobierno-venezolano_233129), no económico. Pero incluso suponiendo que fuese económico e involucrase a toda Venezuela, no se explica que la nación haya entrado en una crisis mucho antes de que las sanciones nacieran.

EXTRAS:
-----------------

**#E1 Mexico/Argentina/Nicaragua... están peor que Venezuela.**

Para esto, se tiene que hacer una comparativa para buscar semejanzas, **y ver si el país X está peor que Venezuela**. Esto último no lo entienden. Pero en fin. Para decir que un país está peor que Venezuela, ese país debe tener:

* [Crisis humanitaria](http://www.el-nacional.com/noticias/mundo/onu-aprobo-resolucion-sobre-crisis-humanitaria-venezuela_253427) y de [DDHH](http://espaciopublico.ong/consejo-de-ddhh-aprobo-resolucion-por-crisis-en-venezuela/) reconocida por varias organizaciones regionales.

* [Inflación de más del 5000%.](http://efectococuyo.com/principales/inflacion-en-venezuela-puede-alcanzar-4-000-000-estima-economista-luis-oliveros/)

* [Pobreza extrema de 60% o más.](https://www.elpais.com.uy/mundo/pobreza-extrema-dispara-venezuela.html)

* [Salario mínimo de $5 o menos **al mes**.](http://www.el-nacional.com/noticias/economia/dolar-paralelo-supero-salario-minimo-venezuela_247568)

Échenle bolas.


**#E2 Venezuela no es socialista, es [capitalismo de estado](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxímoron)**

¿Cómo se le llama a la propiedad privada a manos del estado? Propiedad pública, ¿y el motor del Capitalismo cuál es? ¿La propiedad pública?

Otro problema es que es muy difícil decir que Venezuela es capitalista cuando tiene no solo a un estado todopoderoso que [sataniza a la propiedad privada](https://www.elimpulso.com/featured/venezuela-es-el-pais-de-latinoamerica-con-menos-respeto-a-los-derechos-de-propiedad-13ago), sino que también posee [organizaciones comunitarias](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colectivo_(Venezuela) ), [empresas a manos de estos colectivos](http://www.venezuelaaldia.com/2018/10/09/colectivos-chavistas-los-nuevos-directores-los-hospitales-venezuela/), el [índice de libertad económica **más bajo** de la región](https://www.heritage.org/index/country/venezuela), [se hacen llamar Socialistas](http://www.vicepresidencia.gob.ve/index.php/2018/09/04/venezuela-avanza-hacia-un-nuevo-modelo-economico-socialista/)... Es difícil pensar que es otra cosa aparte del mismo Socialismo que ya todo el planeta conoce. Porque, siendo sincero, tampoco es que el Socialismo haya significado algo distinto a la inutilidad y caos que tiene Venezuela. Décadas de socialismo soviético lo prueban.


************Lo logré muchachos Soy el mismo OP de este [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/vzla/comments/15kzb2w/he_comido_de_la_basura/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Han pasado muchas cosas desde entonces. Solo recuerdo que los últimos meses del año pasado fueron terribles. A parte de trabajar en el cine, estaba reprobando una materia en la universidad. Estaba tan estresado que se me dormian las manos y diciembre del 2023 la pasé trabajando y estudiando 24/7. Recuerdo que estaba tan pegado al chasis que no tenía bolso para ir a la universidad. Todos estaban rotos e iba con uno de hacer ejercicio. A inicios de este año me despidieron de ese trabajo (larga historia) y una amiga me consiguió un trabajo como programador.

Recuerdo que por allá en 2020 cuando comencé aquí en reddit me interesó todo el tema de programación. Como tenía tiempo libre por la cuarentena, me dediqué en lo que pude a aprneder de HTML, CSS y JS por mi cuenta. Incluso gente de este sub me orientaron a aprender. Cursos gratis de youtube y páginas como frontendmentor me sirvieron para tener una sólida base como programador frontend y para tener un buen portafolio. El punto está en que conseguí ese empleo gracias a aquella decisión y tiempo libre que tuve hace cuatro años (Luego puedo hacer otro post acerca de mi experiencia como programador Jr.)

Las cosas en ese empleo empeorarorn. La paga era bastante poca. Al rededor de 200$ al mes. Era poco pero dediqué cada quincenca a ahorrar y tratar de mejorar un poco mi calidad de vida ya que desde enero de este año estoy durmiendo en el mueble de mi casa y no tenía una computadora para hacer mis trabajos de la universidad o simplemente para distraerme.

Me costó mucho sobrevellevar ese trabajo. Estudiaba a la vez que trabajaba y llegaba a mi casa reventado. A pesar de eso, mis prioridades eran claras: Ahorrar para pagar mi universidad y comprar una computadora.

Recientemente renuncié. Conseguí un mejor empleo como ingeniero de transmisiones en un canal de televisión. Fue una oportunidad que me salió gracias a la recomundación de un profesor. Trabajé poco tiempo como programador. Al rededor de cinco meses. Tiempo suficiente para pagar mi último semestre de la universidad y comprarme una nueva laptop.

Se me pone el corazón pequeño recordar todo. Hace un año trabajaba hasta tarde barriendo pisos, limpiando cotuferas y botando montones y montones de basura en el basurero de los centros comerciales. Hoy en día las cosas son distintas, tanto que en mi nuevo empleo me presentaron como "El nuevo ingeniero en transmisiones del departamento". No me cabe el orgullo en el pecho.

Las cosas mejoran si uno le pone cariño, sacrificio y bastante disciplina. Agradezco cada uno de los usuarios que me dieron apoyo en aquel momento. Solo le doy gracias a Dios por cada adversidad, puesto que cada una me forma y me construye como un hombre de bien. Aún faltan cosas por mejorar, pero todo a su debido tiempo. Paso a paso.

************He comido de la "basura" Este año ha Sido de muchos eventos canónicos. Primero lo de mi mi [accidente laboral](https://www.reddit.com/r/vzla/comments/15bitkn/mi_experiencia_con_retrovirales_accidente_laboral/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=2), me he sentido solo sentimentalmente y muchos problemas económicos.

Estudio en una universidad privada. Actualmente estoy becado pero tengo mi familia tiene un par de necesidades económicas. Estoy de vacaciones y dije "quiero hacer dinero mientras esté libre". Mandé CV a cuánta empresa hubiera y ninguna me contactó. Necesito dinero para ayer. Quiero hacer el dinero suficiente para pagar mi semestre y no depender ya to de mi mamá. No me quedó más que hablar con un pana del liceo que trabajaba en cinex. Me explicó cómo era la vuelta y me postulé. Desde hace una semana estoy trabajando allí.

Honestamente me cayó mal y me sentí triste. Pues cinco años de carrera de ingeniería, un título de bombero y años de estudio de música para venir terminando barriendo pisos y limpiando salas de cine y trabajando con gente "malandrosa". No quería que nadie me viera trabajando ahí, parece que el universo me escuchó y uno de mis compañeros me vió mientras trabajaba. Lo ignoré pues me daba pena que él desde su posición privilegiada de niño de papá y mamá me viera haciendo ese trabajo. 

Llego muy tarde a mi casa y por lo menos cuento con transporte. En un fin de semana hago 25$ pero pueden ser 45$ en una semana, tengo que cuadrar bien.

El sábado pasado era muy tarde y estaba trabajando aún. Eran como las 11 de la noche y estaba limpiando una sala. Estaba solo en esa tarea. Tenía muchísima hambre. Generalmente la gente deja cotufas y los chicos con los que trabajo se las comen. Yo en un principio dije que no lo haría, pues quién sabe cuántas infecciones podría agarrar haciendo eso (y de infecciones me considero un experto ya xd).

La excepción ocurrió ese día. Tenía mucha hambre. El estómago me dolía y el olor a cotufas, refresco y dulce me mariaban. Mi trabajo de limpieza consistía, entre otras cosas, en agarrar los potesitos de cotufas, botar su contenido en la basura y romper el cartón. Tenía tanta hambre que justo antes de tirar un potesisto, sin percatarme ya tenía una bola de cotufas en mi boca, continué comiendo y no me controlaba. Seguí comiendo rápido antes de que alguien me viera y así hice para calmar el hambre. Terminé y continué limpiando.

Me sentí que había caído en mi punto más bajo. Me dió mucha tristeza, pues al llegar a mi casa abracé a mi mamá. Días antes había llorado junto a ella porque me frustraba la situación del trabajo y toda nuestra situación en general. Me dijo que no me avergonzara de mi trabajo, sino al contrario, que me sienta orgulloso de mi deseo de superación.

Obviamente no se lo he dicho a nadie. Solo paso por acá para desahogarme, pues internet y el anonimato dan muchas ventajas.

Queda seguir adelante y no rendirme. Hago mi mejor esfuerzo. Constantemente me repito que "no soy pobre, sino que simplemente no tengo dinero". Sé que es una situación temporal y que solo es algo transitorio.

El post es para preguntar si tienen alguna idea o situación graciosa que valga la pena plasmar en un dibujo?

Me gusta mucho hacer este tipo de obras que transmiten esa sensación a cuando uno era un chamito y la plata onte la gustabas en una empana con malta o se la dabas a la sifrina a ver si te paraba pelotas.

Cualquier opinión o idea es bien recibida. Quizás pueda hacer más obras basadas en eso y doy créditos a quienes me colaboren x)

...Si, me tuve que salir de la sala de prensa.   
No sabía si indignarme, arrecharme, llorar desconsoladamente, pero después de decir vainas como que los inmigrantes se comen los perros y los gatos en Springfield, y que hasta su perro lo secuestraron y se lo comieron los inmigrantes, decidí que me ve iba a reír, y me he reído, tanto que me duelen los pulmones.

************¿Por qué tener relaciones con M3n0r3s de 3d4d esta tan normalizado? Osea, me refiero a aqui en Venezuela, la verdad es muy comun ver a niñas de 11 a 17 embarazadas o tener relaciones sexuales o de cualquier tipo con adultos de mas de 20 años y que la excusa que siempre dices es que "si ella quiere pues dejela ser". Osea, un menor de edad es eso, no entiendo porque las madres y padres hoy en dia aquí son tan despreocupados y que no tengan la capacidad de orientar a sus hijos, y como no lo hacen solo "benefician" a una manga de pedofilos degenerados que se aprobechan de estas niñas.

Mi mama es profesora en un liceo y en lo que va del nuevo año escolar ya hay al menos 2 niñas por cada salon desde 1 a 5 años embarazadas, estamos hablando de 34 salones, incluso hay casos de niñas de 12 y 14 que ya viven con hombres de 20 a 25 años ¿osea que esta pasando aqui? no se si es solo por aqui donde vivo pero si he viajado a varios estados como anzoategui, apure y guarico y he visto que hay la misma tendencia, pero esto porque pasa osea, estamos hablando de niñas, es decir NIÑAS! si me entiendes, en que cabeza cabe sentir atraccion sexual por una niña que no tiene ni cuerpo ni nada, que tan morboso hay que ser broh? 

Que alguien me explique porque pasa esto y como hago yo para cuidar a mis hijas porque la verdad si esto es algo que se esta normalizando me voy a vivir a una cueva.

Hola, amigos, 

Soy francés. 

Durante mucho tiempo, el chavismo fue par mi símbolo de lucha contra el imperialismo. La famosa tercera vía que todos los partidos políticos europeos estaban buscando desde la era soviética. 

Si eres europeo y tienes una tendencia de izquierda, todos los medios nos presentan Chávez así. Todavía algunos siguen defendiendo Maduro. Por la izquierda europea, las ataques contra el chavismo son el hecho de medias de comunicación de "la extrema derecha venezolana», o de "las medias capitalistas yankees" que no suportan que un poder se "pone de pie contra el capitalismo y el imperialismo".

Todo cambió cuando me fui en América Latina, en Perú precisamente. Ahí, empecé a encontrarme con venezolanos, bien antes de la muerte de Chávez, en 2011 si me recuerdo bien. Me acuerdo de mi primer encuentro con venezolanos que era de la oposición. En mi mente, era la oposición era básicamente gente de los barrios más ricos de Caracas, porque el chavismo hizo tanto por las clases populares (de lo que creía). 

Pero esta persona no era de clase alta. Empezó a explicarme lo que estaba pasando. Explicarme las mentiras. 

Me intereso bastante, y como mi español mejoro bastante, empecé a leer fuentes originales. A cambiar mis fuentes de información, y hablar directamente con gente que vive en Venezuela. 

Me di cuenta de una cosa importante: 

Todo lo que pensé saber de Venezuela, todo que lo que algunas medias me contaron, es únicamente el discurso palabra por palabra del régimen. 

No voy a negar mi pasado con la izquierda, porque lo que me aprendió es de pensar por yo mismo y de no creer todo lo que dice el estado. Cualquier estado tiene una propaganda, una verdad que quiere hacer creer a la gente. Ahí está la gran hipocresía de la izquierda europea. Denuncia la propaganda yankee o de la Unión Europea (a veces con justo razón) pero van a repetir el discurso de los gobiernos y de los estados que le conviene. 

Como por ejemplo, una cosa me indigno últimamente en Francia. Un grupo político llamo al boicot de Chile, denunciando el hecho que Piñera esta " matando a su pueblo». Eso se puede conversar, pero mi indignación viene que es el mismo grupo que apoya a Maduro, y cuando Maduro mandó las tanquetas contra el pueblo, ellos apoyaron al opresor.

Otra hipocresía de la izquierda internacional que podemos resumir a "Apoyamos a todos los pueblos oprimidos (aparte si el opresor es socialista)"

Al final me casé con una venezolana. La ayudé, hicimos venir su madre y su hermano en Perú. Trabajamos duro para poder dar un futuro mejor a la familia. Afrontamos la xenofobia en Perú, y también la llegada de malandros venezolanos en Perú (hay que ser sincero, lastimosamente, no ha llegado únicamente los mejores elementos de Venezuela)

Lo que indigna hoy, es la hipocresía y la ignorancia de los europeos. Perdí varios amigos que pensaba saber mejor que los venezolanos lo que está pasando allá. Insultaron mi familia, mi esposa y a mí porque no apoyo a Maduro. Me mandan artículos de RT o de Telesur, diciendo que soy un idiota que cree la propaganda capitalista y que tengo que leer Telesur para darme cuenta de la verdadera situación en Venezuela. Cuando explico que mi familia es venezolana, o me tildan de troll, o me contestan que no soy objetivo para analizar la situación porque tengo líos sentimentales. Pretenden saber mejor que los venezolanos lo que está pasando. Mira [r/worldpolitics](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpolitics) por ejemplo. El thread sobre Bolivia es lleno de gente que nunca fueron en Bolivia pero que explica tranquilamente que es un golpe de estado de la derecha boliviana, apoyado por la CIA. Mismo discurso sobre los temas de Venezuela.

   
 

Lo peor es que yo sé que es el cuotidiano de muchos acá. Que gente que viene de Europa o Estados Unidos, viene a explicarlos como pensar. Yo viví indirectamente eso, y no es mi país, me llena de una intensa ira, entonces no puedo imaginar lo que sienten ustedes, la impotencia que se puede sentir.

Por eso mi gran mensaje.

Quiero mandarle un fuerte abrazo, decirlos que aparte una mancha de izquierdistas, mucha gente piensa en ustedes y que guardamos la esperanza de ver un día una Venezuela libre. 

No cambiara las cosas este mensaje, pero sentí la necesidad de comunicarlos mi ira y mi cariño por un pueblo que conozco bien y aprecio bastante.

Saludos hermanos.

Edit: Se prendió esta vaina. No pensé tener tantos comentarios y tantas bonitas repuestas a lo que fue una catarsis para mí. No respondí a todos pero leí todos. Muchas gracias a ustedes!

Uno debe tomarse un respiro y aprender a aceptar lo bueno que te pasa y lo que consigues, valorar tu esfuerzo y el que los demás hacen por ti para verte bien. Al día de hoy tengo un buen empleo, vivo con mis tíos los cuales me quieren y me valoran, empecé la universidad luego de haberla congelado, deje de tratar gente basura que solo me hacía daño, me hice responsable de mis actos y hoy pude comprarme mi primera lapto para poder estudiar y trabajar (gracias a una licitación en el trabajo).

Llegó a Estados Unidos en septiembre del año pasado y en menos de un año en el país, ya comenzó a hacer guevonadas. No pudo dejar atrás sus antecedentes de malandro en Venezuela y empezar una vida mejor a su corta edad. La verdad es que esta lacra está ensuciando la reputación de todos los venezolanos que realmente vienen en busca de una vida mejor. Intento defender a Venezuela cuando algunos hablan mal de nosotros, pero ¿cómo puedo hacerlo si hay gente como ellos que no quieren adaptarse a la sociedad?

Hace un par de meses que me mudé a Madrid (ya no vivo allí) y conocí a gente similar a mí, empecé a salir más de fiesta y por primera en muchos años tuve gente con la que hablar de temas diferentes de los que no podía conversar con el típico venezolano, me sentí joven de nuevo luego de muchos años resentido.

Sobre ese orden de ideas MCM no puede decir ni por asomo que se salga a protestar como se ha venido haciendo, debe llamar a la familia, a los movimientos cívicos familiares y pacíficos ya que al escrutinio público el hacer lo contrario podría ser motivo de cuestionar realmente la historia del régimen (que si es bastante improbable pero en la política pasa cada cosa que es irrisorio). Ella sabe cómo han terminado los últimos movimientos de protesta en Venezuela y sabe que siempre han sido como una estocada, para parte y parte, pero mientras más se haga será más fuerte para el régimen; ya tenemos la mirada internacional encima de una manera muy atenta, además de la tendencia que podría encontrarse en los movimientos pidiendo por intervención, el recurrir a la represión podria acelerar cualquier decisión por parte de la comunidad internacional.

Ví el vídeo que subió llamando a la movilización el sábado y si sabes leer entre líneas como se ha venido comportando y la manera en la que habla puedes darte cuenta de que realmente hay mucho más cocinandose de lo que nos puede demostrar y nosotros lo mínimo que podemos hacer es apoyarla.

P.D: Sé que lamentablemente la mayoría de mis hermanos venezolanos estan muy desanimados y la gran mayoría ya se dieron por derrotados, pero si aún les queda algo de esperanza lo mínimo que pueden hacer es no intentar desesperanzar a los demás.


************Cómo dividir aún más al régimen... Una idea. El régimen en cierta medida está dividido y aunque se entiende que sacarlos por las malas es difícil por no decir imposible sin mucho sacrificio, creo hay opciones más "sutiles" a considerar.


Al parecer mucha gente pro-maduro están denunciando para que secuestren a opositores o miembros de mesa. Entonces porque no aprovechar este sistema de represión y usarlo en contra de los mismos chavistas? 

Falsificar chats de WhatsApp, conversaciones y demás cosas con IA para inculpar a chavistas de "traidores a la patria" podría ser una herramienta efectiva si se usa sobretodo contra familiares de personas en el poder, un militar, soldado, policía, funcionario... Etc.


Que mejor manera de tumbar un régimen autoritario que sembrando la duda y el odio entre ellos mismos? Sino podemos nosotros, hagamos que ellos se destruyan entre si mismos.


Que tal la idea?

Soy el unico extranjero en el edificio. Cuando preguntaron hacia donde van las llamadas, obviamente dijo Venezuela. Claro que sí. El coñisimo de la madre.

Dijeron que no había que echar culpas, pero es que no había que hablar para darse a entender. La mirada de todo el mundo lo decía todo.

La tipa puso una denuncia a la policía, y ojalá se resuelva pronto esta vaina, porque el coñisimo de la madre. A veces me pregunto si estas vainas me hubieran pasado si no hubiera salido de Venezuela. Que rabia tener que quedar como el ladrón, el necesitado, el que pinchaba la línea del edificio, para llamar al exterior.

No tengo la necesidad. Pero claro, porque tengo un acento latino y las llamadas van hacia donde vengo, el culpable soy yo.

Maldito Chávez, maldito Maduro y maldita sea toda la familia de quien ocupa un alto cargo en el gobierno. ¿Que necesidad había de pasar esta arrechera?

************Tuve un accidente en el trabajo y me congelé una mano y no me ayudaron,  Bueno como en el titulo. Ayer en el trabajo tuve un accidente llenando una bombona de gas de refrigerante de nevera, la manguera salió disparada y yo reaccioné  a taparla con la mano y se me congeló como una piedra. En el trabajo no me dieron ningun tipo de atención y ayuda al momento, tuve que meter la mano en agua al momento para que se me descongelara y vi el infierno.

Ese dolor era insoportable, y de paso mientras estaba tirado en el piso pegango gritos con una mano en el agua el encargado de pacotilla del negocio me decia que eso no era nada que reposara la mano y siguiera trabajando como si nada, y yo con una arrechera y un dolor grandisimo y una impotencia tremenda. 

Grabé un video de la mano en ese momento aguantando el dolor como podía y se lo pasé al jefe y el muy perro lo veía normal que siguiera trabajando. 

Total que agarré mi morral y me fuí como pude caminando aguanyando el dolor en un bus a un ambulatorio, sólito,  sin ningún tipo de ayuda de esa gente. Llorando, mi mamá en otro estado y yo solito ahí sintiéndome desanparado total.

En el ambulatorio me atendieron y me pusieron un analgésico en inyección y me mandaron la crema de plata para las quemadas y ketoprofeno en pastillas y pa la casa!

Yo me fuí en bus al centro, compré lo que me dijeron con lo que tenía maniado con una sola mano y el dolor insoportable y con esa mano poniéndose negra de la quemadura de esa hipotermia. 

Total que a pie en bus me fuí con ese solaso y tapandome la mano del sol con paño llegué a donde mi tía a recibir calor de madre, que me atendiera, comer, tener un poco de consuelo y amor familiar y que me aplicara la crema. 

Ahi estuve como 2-3 horas aguantando el dolor y tomando decisiones para resolver porque esa es una casa vieja sin agua y yo estaba seguro que hay no me iba quedar.

Terminé yéndome a mi casa que queda del otro lado de la ciudad y con gran parte del transporte parado por el partido de la vinotinto.

Hasta la noche tarde no pude ir al hospital, yo me comunique como a las 7 con la gente de mi iglesia y se movieron y le hicieron presión a ese gente y fue que me llevaron al médico. 

Así tenia la mano, adjunto fotos.

En el hospital fué rudo pero me atendieron excelente por lo menos. Me dijero que tengo alto riesgo de perder los deditos.

Y bueno eso a mi me pone on edge, nojoda chamo, primero los peos de las elecciones y las persecuciones y toda esta sosobra. 

Antes de eso meses buscando trabajo remoto y nada, llevo un año buscando y nada agarré este trabajo de mierda que no tiene ningún tipo se seguridad laboral y es completamente explotativo por la desesperación y la necesidad,  30$ semanal a BCV pagan de miseria que no da para nada y el unico día libre es el domingo y todos los días sales tarde y wuieren que te quedes despues del horario. Nojoda y mis 2 papas viejos y enfermos, y ahora con este peo vale.

Yo buscando medio resolver, aceptando calarme el trabajo explotativo y ahora con peligro de perder la mano y pelando.

Escribo esto con una sola mano, desde mi casa el dia siguiente, ya con una venda en la mano que me pusieron en el hospital.  Principalmente para desahogarme ante esta situacion horrible que bueno día a día nos toca a todos en Venezuela.

Sobre mi busqueda de trabajo online, solo he podido ganar experiencia en cositas que son por comision que no me han dado resultado. Tengo ingles nivel C1 y estoy proximo a terminar mi carrera aunque ahorita esta de paro pir falta de como pagar la uni. Siempre he sido tech savvy, se bastante de computadoras, atencion al cliente, se usar quickbooks, se llevar bien agendas pata clientas,  tengo experiencia haciendo inventarios de todo tipo, muchos años de experiencia en ventas. Y soy bueno en excel y tengo nociones basicas de programacion ya que empezando el año estaba dándole a Odin Project y Codeacademy, tambien soy bueno para data entry y esas cositas

************La izquierda me decepcionó. Yo siempre me he considerado de derecha por OBVIAS razones. El chavismo destruyó mi país. Sin embargo, es algo muy típico de la derecha los discursos de racismo, homofobia, etc. Esas son cosas que yo no comparto, y la izquierda suele defender a esas minorías. ¿Que pasó? Que estuve en un debate interno por un tiempo de "Coño, capaz la izquierda no es mala, sino que simplemente el chavismo es una izquierda de mierda y ya, no los debería meter a todos en la misma bolsa" Y me planteé darles una oportunidad.

Pero no.

Los tremendos genios, han decidido apoyar a la dictadura de Maduro, sin importar las atrocidades que ha hecho. El gobierno ha perseguido y matado gente que solo busca un cambio (básicamente un fascismo en toda regla) ¿No se supone que la rebelión contra un estado opresor es lo que apoya la izquierda? Incluso llegaron a perseguir y casi meter preso a Koddy Campos, un activista de la comunidad LGBTIQ+ ¿Por que no veo a ningún Petrista de Colombia, o Kirchnerista de Argentina condenando acciones como esa? ¿O, por que no veo al feminismo latinoamericano celebrar que la lider de la oposición Venezolana es una mujer bien valiente? No, para ellos es una "golpista, facista, imperialista, etc"

Entonces me di cuenta de algo: La izquierda solo tiene ojos para criticar lo malo que haga la derecha, pero si otro gobierno de izquierda comete un genocidio, buscan mil argumentos para justificarlo y te tachan de "fascista" si estás en contra de ellos.

Hubo alguna que otra excepción como el presidente de Chile que es de izquierda pero tuvo algo de sentido común, cosa que agradezco, ah pero fíjate, justamente los de izquierda lo andan criticando y casi que tildando de "traidor" simplemente por tratar de apoyar al pueblo Venezolano.

De verdad que la izquierda me decepcionó y defraudó a toda Venezuela, y mientras los siga viendo así de radicales apoyando dictaduras a su conveniencia, jamás los volveré a voltear a ver. Son unos hipócritas.

************En mi casa me hacen la vida imposible porque dicen que “me falta calle” Sencillamente me viven faltando el respeto porque dicen “que me falta calle” y la razón es que yo no trabajo de forma presencial, yo teletrabajo y gano muy por encima de lo que pagan por ahí. 

Parece que les da arrechera no verme levantarme a las 4/5/6 am para vestirme, salir de la casa y agarrar un autobús para ir al trabajo hasta las 4 de la tarde. Tengo otra forma de ganarme la vida gracias a dios por haber aprendido inglés y holandés y puedo ganar dinero desde mi casa de forma estable. 


Ellas faltas de respeto van desde creer que tengo ser el cachifo de la casa y todo lo que eso implica, hasta decirme que estoy “loco”, “agüevoniado” cuando en realidad no soy un carajo ni loco, ni aguevoniado ni nada por el estilo, no soy el más avión pero si tengo buen vida social, se solucionar mis problemas, salgo, voy al gym pero les da arrechera mi forma de ganarme la vida. 

Además de esto soy sumamente colaborador con mi casa, siempre estoy pendiente de comprar lo que falta, no me gusta la fiesta, no salgo de noche, no me gusta la droga, el amiguismo ni la vida alegre. Soy un carajo bien pero a la misma vez muy sereno pero no me soportan. 


De hecho, el año pasado hice pasantías en una empresa donde me pagaban $70 AL MES y quedaban al otro extremo del estado donde vivo. Literalmente tenía que levantarme casi que a las 4 a agarrar un autobús, para estar ahí hasta las 4 raneando para después llegar a mi casa por SETENTA DÓLARES. Pero curiosamente ahí mi mamá jodia menos y me respetaba más. 


Quiero saber si han atravesado situaciones parecidas y que les parece los que les cuento

************Que les parece mi dibujo?  


************¡Alerta! Está circulando esta peligrosa información. Esto dice Ivan Duque

  
Se habla de que en el interior del Tribunal Supremo de Justicia de Venezuela se estaría estudiando la posibilidad de declarar nulas las elecciones, dado que la data pudo haberse corrompido debido al "ataque cibernético" que Maduro quiere utilizar como cortina de humo."  
  
¿Por qué este es un escenario estratégico y posible para la dictadura?  
  
1. El TSJ ordenó al CNE, entre otras cosas, que le suministrara toda la información técnica que dé fe del "ataque cibernético" del cual el CNE afirma haber sido víctima el domingo 28 de julio, razón por la cual no ha podido suministrar las actas.  
  
2. El presidente de Colombia, Gustavo Petro, sugeriría repetir las elecciones para ayudar a Maduro, y se está buscando que México y Brasil hagan lo propio.  
  
Ahora bien, ¿sobre qué elementos probatorios el TSJ daría este dictamen?  
  
El TSJ afirmará que consultó a una o dos empresas especializadas en ciberseguridad y que, tras analizar toda la información técnica suministrada por el CNE sobre el “ataque cibernético”, concluyó que efectivamente ocurrió, y que, como consecuencia, una parte significativa de los datos fue corrompida. Conseguir un informe técnico forense de ciberseguridad de una empresa especializada no les será difícil; dinero no falta, y el dinero lo compra casi todo.  
  
Al estar los datos corrompidos, estos no reflejan con certeza y veracidad la voluntad expresada, lo que justificaría administrativa y legalmente que los boletines emitidos por el CNE fueron basados en información corrompida por el "ciberataque", liberando al Sr. Amoroso y a los rectores del CNE de responsabilidad legal, al no haber intencionalidad de favorecer a uno de los candidatos, sino que su decisión se basó en cifras no reales y corrompidas.  
  
Dirán que especialistas en ciberseguridad así lo confirman. Por lo tanto, decretarán de obligatorio cumplimiento lo siguiente:  
  
1. Ordenar al CNE desproclamar a Maduro, lo cual disminuiría la presión nacional e internacional.  
  
2. Ordenar al CNE realizar una nueva elección presidencial para la primera quincena de diciembre de 2024.  
  
Esto permitirá al chavismo salir del rincón donde está arrinconado y reorganizar sus fuerzas. Tendrán un período de cuatro meses para corregir todas las fallas, blindar el sistema y garantizar su triunfo en diciembre.  
  
3. Ordenar al gobierno garantizar a la oposición las condiciones y garantías para el desarrollo de su campaña electoral.  
  
4. Ordenar al gobierno la liberación inmediata de todas las personas que fueron retenidas como consecuencia de las manifestaciones, lo cual daría un alivio social.  
  
En definitiva, con esta decisión, el TSJ juega el papel de "policía bueno" y "sabio", cuya decisión produciría de inmediato los siguientes efectos:  
  
A. Congelar la situación, ya que no habría motivos para protestar.  
  
B. Quitar el sesgo de fraude, dado que los datos utilizados fueron alterados por el ciberataque.  
  
C. Complacer a un sector de la “Comunidad Internacional”, garantizando un nuevo proceso y anulando el actual.  
  
D. Dar al régimen cuatro meses para que se blinde y pueda garantizar su victoria en diciembre.  
  
Este plan debe evitarse. Edmundo González es el presidente elegido por el pueblo, como lo demuestra el 82% de las actas publicadas por los valientes testigos electorales de la resistencia democrática. Este resultado evidencia un triunfo abrumador. El veredicto del pueblo debe ser respetado. ¡No más trampas de la dictadura! ¡Venezuela libre

Si necesitara mas plata estando en Brasil entonces tendré que buscar otro part time que me permita cubrir esos gastos.

No me hará falta nada, más que mi familia porque amigos nunca he tenido, me consideraban un freak, un raro, un ratón de biblioteca y creo, y espero poder hacer las amistades que aquí nunca pude hacer.

 Creo que hay formas de decir las cosas, por ejemplo conocí a un señor de la India y lo que me dijo al yo decirle que venía de Venezuela fue: "Y tu familia en tu casa como está? para ellos la situación está difícil?" Una forma muy diferente de preguntar sobre la situación.

  Decidí alejarme y por suerte encontré 4 Venezolanos también de la empresa en el paseo e hicimos grupo por el resto de la actividad.

¿Ustedes que hubieran hecho? En donde estoy conozco personas de todo el mundo y es normal que tengan curiosidad de Venezuela, pero lo que me molestó es la forma.

************Observaciones de mis vacaciones en Venezuela Hace un tiempo pregunté acá qué como estaban las cosas en Venezuela ya que planeaba ir de vacaciones. Varias personas me dieron consejos y otras me escribieron pidiéndome que, cuando volviera, escribiera un resumen de lo que yo encontré. Yo la pasé mayormente en Caracas, pero viajé un fin a Valencia y otro a Cabudare. 

*FYI - yo me fui en el 2016 y no había ido de vuelta desde entonces*

**Maiquetía**: al momento tienes que llenar una planilla por el sitio web de CasaLab y eso lo muestras cuando llegues. Te hacen un PCR que en mi caso, ya estaba incluido en el boleto así que no me tocó pagar nada. Si te toca pagar son $60 en efectivo. Todavía se está usando mascarilla en todos lados, inclusive en sitios abiertos y en la calle.

**Plata**: pude pagar en casi todos los sitios con mi tarjeta internacional. Yo me llevé 3 tarjetas diferentes: una de crédito, una de débito y una Amex. Usé siempre la de débito. En sólo un par de sitios no me aceptaron mi tarjeta (en un restaurante en El Hatillo y una licorería en La Candelaria). 

Yo tambien me llevé $300 en efectivo, más que todo en billetes de 1, 5, 10 y 20. Muchas cosas te cuestan $1 (por ejemplo, una empanada, un agua, etc). Si llevas billetes de $1 te van a amar. Nadie los tiene y pues, dar vuelto es díficil. Yo tenía como 100 en billetes de 1. Además, es necesario para esos lugares en los que no te aceptan tu tarjeta.

**Taxis y deliveries**: hay varias app que no existían cuando yo me fui. Yo usé Ridery para taxis. Una carrera me salía en promedio en $5. Hacia el aeropuerto me salió en $25. Es una versión de Uber. Funciona perfecto pero igual el taxista siempre me preguntaba que pa dónde iba y me preguntaban como llegar lo cual me pareció gracioso pero más allá de eso, no puedo decir nada malo. 

También hay apps para deliveries de comida y otras cosas como Yummy y PedidosYa. Tampoco me puedo quejar ya que resuelven. Muchos sitios también tienen su propio delivery si les escribes por Instagram o WhatsApp.

**Costo de las cosas**: es díficil cuantificar esto pero como referencia yo comí bastante barato en muchos sitios pero varía mucho. Algunos ejemplos acá por si quieren referencias.
- 1 cachito: aprox $1-2
- Restaurante Morandi los Palos grandes (3 platos + 3 bebidas alcohólicas): $40
- Restaurant gourmet en el Hatillo (2 personas + 2 bebidas alcohólicas): $70
- Restaurant de sushi en la trinidad (3 entradas, 3 platos, 4 bebidas alcohólicas): $82
- Farmatodo: 1 shampoo $8 / 1 caja de medicinas $10
- taxi aeropuerto-caracas $25
- taxi en mayor parte de Caracas $5-10 por carrera
- pepitos en Cabudare (5 personas y un coñazo de cervezas): $40
- empanadas en la calle: $1 por empanada, $2 por un batido de parchita 
- Un cafecito - alrededor de $2 por un con leche o $1 por un guayoyo
- botella de Santa Teresa 1796 $28 (a mi me cuesta cómo £50)
- 1 pollo a la brasa con hallaquitas, 1 refresco de 1l y Guasacaca $15 (en La Candelaria)
- cena en Las Mercedes $263 (con servicio de whiskey)
- toldo en la playa en Puerto Cabello $15. Lancha a Isla larga $10pp.  Pescado frito en la playa $25. Polarcitas a $1

Mi presupuesto para este viaje fueron $1000 y gasté $1500. Definitivamente pueden ir y gastar menos pero yo me volví loca y pagué por un coñazo de vainas cuando salía con mi familia. 

**Seguridad**: hay definitivamente una sensación de más calma. Pude sacar mi celular en varios sitios sin que me arrancaran la mano (esto no significa que vas a ser pajúo y no pararle bolas a tus alrededores). Obviamente la policía sigue con sus alcabalas y peos tratando de sacar plata así que yo cargaba siempre poquito efectivo solo porsia. Paseé por el centro, la Candelaria, la av. Fuerzas armadas y la verdad en ningún momento sentí miedo. Saqué fotos y todo. Eso sí, yo me había llevado otro celular que en cualquier caso, no me importaba si me lo robaban e igual estaba siempre pendiente. No me llevé joyas ni mi reloj ni nada que llamara mucho la atención. 

**Otras observaciones:**

- Hay muchos negocios nuevos y construcciones. Las Mercedes tiene mil edificios nuevos. Mucha gente me dijo que esto es lavado de dinero. No tengo pruebas pero tampoco dudas. 

- Caracas se sintió más viva. Hay gente en la calle, hay actividad económica, hay cosas que hacer. Lara es otro peo. Sin agua o sin luz por horas y Barquisimeto se ve...tal cual como cuando me fui. No vi muchos arreglos y más bien se sintió un poco deprimido. Hay gente en la calle y todo pero me dio tristeza ver como poco a poco está decayendo. Valencia es una vaina loca. Un montón de sitios nuevos preciosos, todo iluminado, las calles limpias. Yo no me traje ninguna de mis joyas ni mi reloj y cuando iba a varios sitios en Valencia me dio risa: todos con un Apple watch, tremendas pintas, etc. El Malecón de Puerto Cabello lo arreglaron, tiene nuevos restaurantes, etc etc. De verdad increíble. Valencia fue sin duda el shock más grande que tuve en mi viaje.

- Si vienes y te toca manejar, hay gasolina subsidiada que es barata pero las colas son locas y luego tienes la gasolina en dólares, que se consigue y son como $40 por un tanque full. 

- No hay escasez. Hay quizás marcas raras y muchas importadas pero vas al mercado y está full con todo lo que quieras. 

- El centro de Caracas está muy bonito. Vale la pena ir si es tan sólo para apreciar la diferencia. Hay muchos cafés, restaurantes, tiendas de diseño venezolano, chocolates, etc. 

- Hay menos murales y vergas de Chávez!!

- Si vas para el interior del país, los peajes volvieron. Ya hay varios listos y otros en construcción. 

- Si eres Caraqueño y tienes ganas de ir al Ávila, no vayas al teleférico. Entrada es $7, comida está en promedio $10 y ya no hay paso al Humboldt. Si quieres pasar, son $15. Hay restaurantes y bares pero son costosos. Ves la diferencia entre la gente normal y la gente con plata la tirar pal techo. 

- Me pareció que ahora hay una gran división de clases, mucho más que antes. Hay unas personas viviendo en sus burbujas, ganando en dólares y viviendo experiencias y restaurantes maravillosos y otra gente que está tratando todavía de sobrevivir.  Lo que más pensé fue "verga esto me recuerda a la 4ta República", lo cual es bien irónico. 

- Recomendación: dejarle una tarjeta prepagada a su familia si suelen enviarle dinero. Como muchos lugares aceptan tarjetas internacionales, yo le dejé a mi familia una de mis tarjetas (Monzo, Revolut, etc). 

Bueno, eso fue lo que yo viví. Dejo por fuera cualquier opinión política o vergas así porque ese es otro peo. 

A pesar de todos los peos y cosas de Venezuela, agradezco que pude ir, hablar mi idioma, ver a mi familia y no sentirme fuera de lugar.

Como ejemplo es la reciente viralización de un grupo de pajuos bailando salsa a todo volumen en un parque  nevado en Chile, restregando la bandera y hasta unos en guarda camiza en plena nieve 💀

Esa manía de querer poner una rocola a todo volumen en cualquier lado con los pinga de parlantes. Donde en muchos paises se quejan de que no los dejan dormir, y si uno les dice algo se arrechan y victimizan.

O el de manejar tomados en EEUU y arrecharte porque el policía te multó, alzandote y de paso exigirle que te lleve a tu casa....

Osea ese tipo de vainas uno las ha sufrido aquí en Venezuela por coñazo, y con la migración ahora se estan haciendo muy viral en otros paises. Pero la pregunta es, de donde se originó todo eso?  De donde viene toda esa idiosincracia marginal y tan de barrio?  Porque no es solo ciertos sectores populares, tambien hay gente con plata que se monta en su Jeep, pa la playa con dos cajas de cerveza y los pinga de parlantes en el baul, dandole a todo volumen el reggaeton/salsa,/vallenato y demas mierda.

************Estoy cansado de ser un “inmigrante” Básicamente lo que dice el título. Vivo en Estados Unidos, llevo una buena vida, buen trabajo, estoy por terminar la universidad y mi familia está conmigo; honestamente no tengo quejas, pero el hecho de ser un migrante está acabando con mi salud mental. Los migrantes son el chivo expiatorio de todos los males del país y aunque quisiera irme de EEUU, no importa donde vaya voy a ser un migrante. Obviamente la gran excepción es Venezuela y no he vivido en Venezuela desde hace 7 años cuando era un adolescente, es básicamente un país desconocido para mi y tengo miedo de vivir allá tanto por la inseguridad y la corrupción (que me metan preso por cualquier cosa) y que no creo poder tener una vida profesional en Venezuela; no soy el tipo emprendedor y si no hay posibilidades de desarrollar mi carrera voy a terminar muriéndome de hambre. 
Ya no quiero ser una ficha política, no quiero ser el que quita trabajos, no quiero ser el criminal. Y dudo mucho que el problema se solucione viviendo en otro lado. En Latinoamérica odian a los “venecos” y en todos los países desarrollados los inmigrantes son el antagonista y el origen de los males del estado. Solo escribí esto para desahogarme básicamente y tratar de encontrar comunidad. No sé si debería ver si me voy a otro lado, regresarme a Vzla e intentar sobrevivir o alejarme de todas las noticias para evitar ver cómo siguen culpando a los migrantes de todo

************Mi experiencia saliendo de Venezuela hacia Colombia Pues como había mencionado en un [post anterior](https://www.reddit.com/r/vzla/comments/qr2z7t/cu%C3%A1les_son_los_requisitos_para_sellar_la_entrada/), tenía pensado visitar el país vecino este mes. La semana pasada finalmente viajé y quería compartir mi experiencia aquí, ya que me parece que es poco lo que se consigue respecto a como es realmente viajar por tierra hoy por hoy en Venezuela.

Primero que nada algunas aclaraciones: 

* Lo siguiente es **mi** experiencia de viaje, la de otra persona puede ser totalmente diferente, para bien o para mal
* Viajé desde Caracas hasta Bogotá, por tierra en todo momento
* Salí desde el terminal de La Bandera

&#x200B;

**Primera parte: Salir desde Caracas**

Desde el Terminal de la Bandera, entrando a mano izquierda van a ver las taquillas que ofrecen viajes a distintos estados del país. El pasaje hasta San Cristóbal estaba, hasta la semana pasada al menos, en 40$ mínimo independientemente de la taquilla. Tengan en cuenta que para Diciembre podría ser un poco mas caro

&#x200B;

**¿Cómo es el viaje en si?**

El boleto lo pueden comprar el mismo día del viaje, pero les recomiendo comprarlo en la mañana. Los buses salen en horas de la tarde, pero los puestos están contados y es posible que si los piensan comprar una hora antes de la salida del bus, ya estén llenos. **No hay viajes directos hasta San Antonio del Táchira.** Pueden llegar hasta San Cristóbal en un solo bus, pero allí tendrán que hacer trasbordo si o si.

Dependiendo de como sean para los viajes, puede ser un viaje largo y aburrido, agotador, insufrible, etc. etc. Mentalícense a que van a estar no menos de 14 horas en un bus que no está pensado para viajes largos (yo me fui en uno de esos encava que al menos tenía aire acondicionado, pero cosas como baños y otros lujos probablemente no estarán a su disposición mas allá de las paradas). Vayan al baño antes de salir, llévense algo para entretenerse, carguen bien el celular, cuadren su horario de sueño para dormir, lo que les funcione mejor. Personalmente viajé solo pero si van con alguien que conocen eso podría ayudar mucho. Nuestro viaje hizo 2 paradas, 1 en el estado Cojedes y la otra en Barinas. Aprovechen estas paradas para comer, ir al baño, estirar las piernas, comprar bebidas si se les acabó el agua/comida que llevaban al salir. Desde Barinas ya aceptan pesos colombianos por si viajan con eso

**Los documentos para el viaje:** Primero y principal: **Cédula de Identidad** original laminada a la mano **siempre.** Se las van a pedir, guárdenla en un bolsillo, ténganla siempre lista para sacar. Lleven fotocopias en blanco y negro si pueden solo por si acaso. **Carnet de vacunación contra el Covid:** Solo me lo pidieron una vez, unos trabajadores de la alcaldía de Caracas se subieron al bus antes de salir de La Bandera y los revisaron, aclarando que "el que no lo tenga no viaja". Pero había algunos que sin tarjeta, pero con el papel manuscrito que les dieron el día que se vacunaron, también viajaron. Ignoro si esto pasa siempre, pero es importante que lo tengan. Si no están vacunados, ¿Qué hacen leyendo este post para empezar? Vayan a vacunarse y luego vuelven. **Pasaporte:** Hablaré sobre esto mas adelante pero si lo llevan, que sea en un lugar seguro y que no esté a a vista.

&#x200B;

**Las alcabalas**

No creo exagerar cuando digo que el mayor miedo de viajar es pensar que te van a parar, amenazar, robar todo lo que llevas, y un largo etc. Mi experiencia afortunadamente estuvo libre de todo esto, pero si hay algunas cosas a tomar en cuenta.

1. Estar calmado en todo momento. Cuando paren el vehículo, un funcionario o funcionaria subirá, les pedirá a todos sus cédulas, ustedes se la muestran, se las devuelven y ya está. No actúen de manera sospechosa/que vean que los pueden joder y tengan todos sus papeles en regla.
2. Oficialmente, ustedes van para San Cristóbal. TODOS saben que nadie va para allá. Es un secreto a voces. Pero decir que van para Colombia u otro país es el equivalente a tener un cartel de "matraqueame" en la espalda. Si alguien les pregunta, ustedes van a conocer San Cristóbal, a pasar las fiestas con su familia de allá, se quedan en Barinas para practicar las costumbres locales, que se yo
3. La gente que viaja con niños. Este fue el verdadero problema de mi viaje. Si viajan con niños, deben tener cédulas de ellos, de ustedes (padres/tutores), partidas de nacimiento, permiso de viaje si no son los tutores, todo eso se los van a pedir. Una sola cosa que les suene raro y los van a bajar del bus para "revisar con calma los documentos". En las peores alcabalas esto puede significar hasta una hora de retraso o mas en el viaje dependiendo de cuantas trabas les pongan a esa gente o si están dispuestas a pagar o no. Como dije antes yo viaje solo, pero si van en bus y ven que hay padres con niños, háganse a la idea de que su viaje podrían no ser 14 horas, sino fácilmente 16 o 18 porque el bus está parado hasta que suban todos los pasajeros.

La primera y única inspección de equipaje que me hicieron fue en la bandera antes de abordar el bus. Hay un par de militares en la salida que revisaran sus maletas y bolsos de mano. Por suerte para mi (y consecuentemente desgracia para otros) iban tan pendientes de revisar el equipaje de mujeres y gente con niños que a mi solo me revisaron la maleta, no el bolso de mano (yo no llevaba nada raro, pero una vez mas, ténganlo en cuenta). ¿Qué tan extensiva es la revisión? De nuevo, depende de tu género y con quien viajes, pero en mi caso el oficial solo le metió mano a mi equipaje para verificar que no hubiera nada "sospechoso", lo cual no había, solo ropa. Luego de eso el equipaje va al deposito del bus y no se abre hasta llegar a San Cristóbal.

Las peores alcabalas fueron entrando a Portuguesa, a Barinas y la de La Pedrera ya llegando a San Cristóbal. Fácilmente perdimos una hora en cada una por culpa de la gente que viajaba con niños.

Respecto a la señal y los datos (Movilnet) viene y va durante todo el viaje. Aprovechen cuando si tengan para avisar a sus amigos o familiares que están bien.

**Llegando a San Antonio**

Una vez en San Cristóbal llegan a la terminal, se bajan en la terminal, recogen su equipaje y pueden ir al baño, comerse algo, o irse de una vez en otro bus (como 5$ mas o menos) o en taxi (de 10$ en adelante, aunque de nuevo, los precios pueden variar para cuando ustedes decidan viajar) 

En el trecho de San Cristóbal a San Antonio es como de hora y media o dos horas. Desde que se bajan en San Cristóbal empieza el calor, así que si iban abrigados en el bus, es probable que quieran quitarse la chaqueta o lo que sea de una vez.

Hay como 3 o 5 alcabalas en ese tramo. Yo tuve suerte de que el transporte en el que iba nunca fue parado, bien sea porque nos ignoraron o porque ya estaban matraqueando a alguien mas mientras pasamos. Pero están ahí y que los paren es una posibilidad

**Cruzando hacia Colombia**

Personalmente entré por puente internacional Simón Bolívar, pasando desde la aduana principal de San Antonio. Todo el proceso fue sorpresivamente... Fácil. Le mostré mi cédula a la funcionaria (ni siquiera militar, solo un personal que trabaja allí en el punto de la salida de Venezuela), la vio y me dejó pasar. Ninguna revisión de equipaje ni nada. Lo mismo con los que estaban al final de ese pasillo hecho con barandas blancas, aunque siendo justos, cuando yo pase ya estaban regañando gente o llevándolas a otro lado así que seguro tuve mucha suerte. Consejo si les preguntan que vienen a hacer  o algo: Digan que van a visitar a un familiar en Cucuta, que los esperan al otro lado del puente, algo por el estilo.

Eso si, tengan en cuenta que Colombia tiene un sistema de "Pico y Cédula" para regular la entrada. Los días pares, entra la gente cuyas cedulas venezolanas terminan en 0-2-4-6-8. Los días impares entra la gente con el terminal 1-3-5-7-9. Ejemplo: Mi cedula termina en 2, yo entré un 18 de noviembre. Planifiquen el viaje de manera tal que si su cedula termina en par, salgan un día impar (o viceversa) para que estén allí en la mañana/tarde del día que les toca. Si no lo hacen les toca quedarse esperando hasta el día siguiente, o irse por trochas, no digan que no se les advirtió

Pasado esto siguen derechos y a mano derecha, antes de llegar a Cucuta, está Migración Colombia para que sellen su entrada (la salida en Venezuela no se sella y esto no influye). Yo fui con pasaporte vigente, pero sabiendo lo que me costó conseguirlo (en términos de dinero y tiempo) se que no es una opción para todos. Tengo entendido que pueden sellar con pasaportes vencidos hasta por 10 años, y 2 años después de vencida la prorroga (esto ultimo solo lo lei una vez por ahí, no garantizo que sea verdad)

Para sellar necesitan llenar el check mig, un formulario corto que se hace en la página de migración Colombia. Y llevar impreso o en captura de pantalla en el celular el correo que les va a llegar. Si van para Cucuta pues está bien, dicen eso y ya, si van para otros lados si necesitan decir que van por turismo y tener dirección de donde se van a quedar. A mi no me pidieron tarjeta de vacunación aquí tampoco, pero he oído de gente a la que si, procuren tenerla a la mano.

Si no hacen el check mig les toca hacerlo por allá y esperar el doble de tiempo, ahorrense el dolor de cabeza, es un formulario corto así que no hay excusa para no hacerlo.

**Cucuta**

Saliendo del puente hay un toldo grande y blanco que dice "Migración". Justo afuera hay unos taxis (imposibles de perder, todos son amarillos) que los pueden llevar a su siguiente destino, sea una terminal para agarrar un bus o lo que sea. Si no conocen a nadie, pueden usar esos, pero sepan que van a pagar de mas por la carrera. Lo ideal sería que para este punto ya tengan pesos colombianos en sus manos, pero si llevan solo dólares, pidan que los lleven a alguna casa de cambio primero para que puedan pagarle al taxi y el transporte que vayan a tomar luego. Notar también que en Cucuta hace un calor asqueroso, vístanse teniendo en cuenta esto.

**Ir a Bogotá u otro lado**

Una vez en la terminal u oficina de la empresa que hayan escogido, pueden comprar el boleto hacia su próximo destino. **Importante: Sin pasaporte sellado no viajas, no te venden el boleto.** Necesitas presentar eso y la cédula al momento de comprarlo. Y dar un numero de teléfono también, aunque esto sea un formalismo. Pero ahí mismo saliendo del puente, antes de los taxis, pueden comprar una sim card de Claro, a un costo de 6.000 pesos (dólar y medio o 2 dólares mas o menos), que viene con datos y todo por una semana. Ese numero también les sirve, y de hecho es lo mejor porque la señal de movilnet llega solo hasta el puente.

Los buses son considerablemente mejores en Colombia y el matraqueo no existe, solo hay peajes al entrar y salir de cada localidad. Eso si, hay tráfico y trancones, sobre todo en la capital y al salir de Cucuta. Su viaje de 14 horas o mas fácilmente puede durar mucho mas, pero sin el riesgo de que los robe la gente que, se supone, debería protegerlos. Igualmente aprovechen las paradas, coman, estiren las piernas, ya saben

Si su objetivo es emigrar, váyanse con sus papeles en regla, por favor. Yo se que esto no es fácil, o siquiera posible para muchos, pero es lo mejor que pueden hacer si ese es su plan.

**Conclusiones**

Es perfectamente viable irse por tierra al país vecino, incluso si van solos y nunca habían puesto un pie fuera de Caracas. El miedo y los peligros existen, claro, pero puede que su experiencia no sea tan terrible como la que han tenido que sufrir otros. Creo que todo quedó dicho en este post, pero si tienen alguna otra duda o preguntan, siéntanse libres de hacerla en los comentarios

Cuando la razon por la que se fue a votar es para que luego se pueda demostrar el fraude, y apartir de eso tumbar está mierda (de manera MUY simplificada obvio).

Además que todos los cabezas de machete andan "de esta vaina solo se sale con las armas", pues sal tu genio, osea ¿tu tienes idea de la cantidad tan arrecha de gente que se va morir si nos ponemos en ese plan, los saqueos, dias sin luz, agua ni gas y las vidas humanas que se cobrarían?

EDIT: NO ANDO PROPONIENDO SOLUCIONES, verga ¿porque ustedes creen que yo se que hacer para salir de este peo?

Yo estoy subscrito porque a veces postean cosas interesantes pero mientras no hablen de Venezuela todo bien.

Hoy hago este [comentario](https://imgur.com/QIzvthq) en este [thread](https://imgur.com/syBAdZz),

Díganme si es merecido se baneado por simplemente comentar algo que es un hecho. Pero ese parece ser el ADN de mucha gente, no pueden con la realidad y solo les queda tratar de esconderla.

Pero bueno esto es reddit y casi nunca me han baneado así que vine a "desahogarme" acá. Honestamente no me importa en ban, pero me molesta que la gente quiera meterles mojones a otras personas.

**EDIT:** Luego de preguntar en /r/LateStageCapitalism por qué fui baneado, [les comparto la muy profunda y extraña respuesta que me dieron](https://imgur.com/dnnRluY).

¿Acaso somos fascistas en /r/vzla ? ¿O se refieren a ellos mismos como fascista? Eso no me quedó claro...

Gracias a todos por sus comentarios.

************Me siento muy mal, tengo un cáncer (Linfoma en cabeza y cuello) Es sumamente doloroso, estresante y dañino tener que tomar pastillas cada 6 hrs. No tengo ni para comprar analgésicos en este momento, mi padre abandonó el hogar debido a las dificultades que estamos atravesando y no tengo razón de él. **Hola amig@s, espero te encuentres muy bien y tengas la posibilidad de regalarme 5 minutos y leer mi historia.**

Un cálido abrazo para los lectores, me gustaría empezar diciendo que tengo 27 años, me llamo Abelardo, soy oriundo de La Guaira, antiguo estado Vargas. A lo largo de mi corta vida me han gustado mucho los deportes, el béisbol a mi temprana edad, este fue inculcado por mi abuelo materno, tuve preparamientos para este deporte desde temprana edad, lamentablemente en la adolescencia, me lesioné de un ligamento y un menisco y ahí acabó mi primer sueño. No tenía medios para operarme en ese entonces y me enfoque en estudiar.

Siempre he sido una persona activa, me gusta mucho la actividad física, la música, los climas fríos, el cuidado de los animales y el medio ambiente, no me agradan las grandes ciudades, me gusta el silencio y la tranquilidad, el silencio es vital para mí en algún momento del día para poder escuchar con claridad y atención mis pensamientos.

Soy una persona muy hogareña, nunca me gustó pasar mucho tiempo fuera de casa, cuando llegué a salir a (divertirme) solía preguntarme a mí mismo... a qué viniste, si ya te quieres ir... supongo era esa necesidad de experimentar y ver que tal me sentía con gente a mi alrededor, cosa que ahora la identifico como bastante incómoda, no me identifico como introvertido o asocial...  No me gusta el alcohol, nací en un típico hogar donde la diversión de los fines de semanas era el alcohol y por ende es como un trauma.

Me dediqué a hacer calistenia un tiempo, luego de dejar el béisbol y el resultado fue muy positivo, logré fortalecer mi cuerpo como nunca antes y de pronto abandoné mis rutinas cuando estalló la pandemia y nos tocó estar bajo aislamiento.

Antes de la pandemia las cosas no marchaban muy bien y con la presencia de ella, empeoraron en todo sentido. Me tocó abandonar mi carrera y buscar las posibilidades de independizarme. Encontré empleo en otra ciudad y me mudé sin pensarlo mucho, sentía la gran necesidad de hacer algo con mi vida.

Con el dolor de mi alma congelé mi carrera en el 6to semestre por la necesidad de producir algo para el día a día, pues ya no podía pagar las cuotas en mi universidad y culminar mi carrera. Sé que muchos en Venezuela han tenido que tomar decisiones similares, es horrible.

Luego de emprender esta aventura y estar trabajando por 5 meses, empieza a crecer algo en mi cuello, todo el que lo veía me decía que era un ganglio, desde el primer momento me dolía mucho y tuve que empezar a usar analgésicos para estar medianamente bien, yo pensaba que se trataba de una muela cordal, apenas tuve la posibilidad e extraerla, lo hice y no noté mejoría.   
  
Tuve que vender mis cosas y volver a casa de mis padres en busca de ayuda. Acá inicié un recorrido bastante tedioso con distintos profesionales de la salud, internista, hematólogo, oncólogo, cirujanos, otorrino e incluso maxilofacial, me he hecho 3 tomografías con doble contraste, múltiples exámenes sanguíneos, dentro de ellos ETS, Tiroides, Virus y todo negativo.  
  
El volumen de lo que en un principio era un solo ganglio fue aumentando paulatinamente hasta convertirse en un plastrón ganglionar lo cual es una aglomeración de ganglios en una zona específica. En este momento dicho plastrón tiene aprox 10 CM abarcando zonas y comprimiendo. Tales como, oído, mi glándula parótida,  mi cuello, la parte interior de mi boca y la nuca.

Ha sido un proceso muy difícil y literalmente muy doloroso, de por sí un dolor de cabeza es incómodo, imagínalo de manera crónica y con inflamaciones, en caso de no tomar analgesicos dia a dia en horas puntuales.  


Estar acostado tranquilo y descansar, a veces es muy difícil, casi que imposible sin que antes me haga efecto alguna pastilla analgésica, el peso de mi cabeza me genera dolor al aplastar los ganglios contra la almohada.  
  
He vendido yogurts y helados en estos ultimos 3 meses, aproximadamente desde julio y no es una entrada estable, a veces rogando poder vender algo para comprar alimentos o pastillas. 

He buscado empleo en diversos sitios, y sigo buscando, pensando en matarme a pastillas para poder rendir y generar algo, pero no me llaman de ningún sitio lo cual es sumamente desesperante.

El dia 5 de agosto del año en curso fui operado para extraer tomas de biopsia, me hicieron una cervicotomía (extracción de ganglio en el cuello) y también me biopsiaron en la rinofaringe. Las biopsias dieron positivo para Linfoma de hodking de celularidad mixta, afortunadamente es un cáncer con alta probabilidad de recuperación.

Hay quimioterapias y radioterapias gratuitas en Caracas (Hospital Domingo Luciani), pero vivo en el interior del país (Anzoátegui) y debo cubrir gastos de movilización, hospedaje, manutención y posiblemente pagar algo para recibir prioridad (Ya saben la corrupción que hay en el sector público).

Desde hace 3 días mi padre abandonó el hogar, me dejó a mí, a mi hermano y mi madre luchando esta difícil batalla, creo que es un cobarde, no tengo otro calificativo.   
  
Me duele profundamente esta sensación de abandono, estoy muy deprimido... con lágrimas corriendo por mi rostro, escribo este texto de desahogo buscando ayuda monetaria para cubrir estos gastos de salud.

Creé una campaña en GoFundMe con ayuda de un amigo que está afuera de Venezuela y desafortunadamente el resultado ha sido neutral, mi campaña no ha tenido engage. De igual forma es un poco tedioso recibir donaciones por allí pues hay que esperar una serie de días para que pueda llegar el dinero.

De antemano quiero dar gracias por los buenos comentarios, las bendiciones y las donaciones.

************se esta arreglando 


************Falla solucionada, en Corpoelec estamos para servirle 


************Dejen de creer en fake news, este fue el resultado real 


************Maduro loves this 


************Tengamos claro algo y es que la caída de Maduro es indetenible. Aquí hay que evaluar varios factores que están pasando en varios frentes por decirlo así, la verdad es que Maduro está contra las cuerdas y cualquier acción, conjunta o individual puede hacerlo desesperar más de lo que ya está, acelerando su salida.

Por un lado mcm como estratega política dejo loco a más de uno, bajo estas directrices esta muy claro que Maduro tiene su salida clara de un modo u otro pero mcm mantiene el perfil pacífico por obvias razones, llamando a la paciencia, astucia y resistencia, hay negociaciones de las que no sabemos a nivel internacional y Maduro está cada vez más cercado y abandonado. Ni Rusia ni china lo van a defender porque se estarían arriesgando a una tercera guerra mundial prácticamente al defender una situación donde la injusticia es muy clara, ya que el pueblo venezolano eligió a su presidente electo Edmundo Gonzáles con evidencia abrumadora. 

Sin embargo el pueblo es aparte, ahorita hay una calma antes de la tempestad muy notoria, la paciencia de la gente se está agotando muy rápido por los hechos violentos e injusticias que ha cometido el régimen en muy pocos días, y puede haber un grupo numeroso que ya busque dar pelea seria con armas blancas o lo que tengan a su alcance para neutralizar a estos asesinos, que en marchas pacíficas usan armas de fuego o secuestran, y al observar que organismos como la CPI, OEA impasibles con puro comunicado basura no aporta lo necesario para lo que la gran mayoría de venezolanos exige, justicia. Aunque, no descarto que pueda ser el mismo gobierno poniendo una trampa con este llamado al 11, pero no se cómo le ayudaría ya que al reprimir más agresivamente al pueblo y haber sangre de manera masiva la presión internacional puede ser más contundente al salirse la situación de control dónde se pueden aplicar acciones más fuertes; también el ejército que está inconforme que no son pocos con el actuar de Maduro puede terminar pasándole factura de tal manera que no se necesite esperar hasta enero, pues es seguro que los militares se pongan del lado del pueblo. Por algo Maduro ha traído tantos paramilitares de Cuba o Rusia, no?. 

Es evidente que Maduro va a salir en el trascurso de estos meses, pero con fecha límite en enero ya que es cuando Edmundo asume su poder constitucional y no hace falta ser inteligente para saber que al tener el poder legítimo puede usar recursos internacionales, cuentas bloqueadas, llamados a las armas, contratar ejércitos libertadores, llamar a los militares en el exilio, negociar ya como representante con muchas naciones, en fin las posibilidad ante los tantos escenarios son muchas, pero todo esto es gracias a ls preparación de Corina y su equipo que desnudo al régimen dejando solo la represión e injusticia como su única forma de perpetuarse ILEGITIMAMENTE en el poder. Tengamos fe y paciencia porque Dios está con nosotros y es muy seguro que la salida de Maduro de nuevo recalcó esto, es indetenible.


En este video, el audio explica bien lo que está sucediendo: https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMrbxhwg4/

Échenle un ojo si lo desean, mantengamos siempre comunicados y compartiendo información y sobretodo motivando ya que la desmotivación solo le sirve al régimen que sabe que está perdido.

PD: Por algo Lula, Petro y AMLO ya recularon(Les jalaron las orejas) en su comunicado y exigen a Maduro verificación imparcial de las actas, y nosotros sabemos que no lo harán.

ACASO ES UN HOBBIE O QUE VAINA????

La gente que prende candela lo que quema es basura en la mayoría de veces, y yo entiendo que el aseo pasa es cada 2 meses y tales, eso ya lo sabemos todos, pero chamo usted es TAAANNN plasta de m€erd@ como para ponerse a quemar esa vaina y que los demás se tengan que comer todo ese humo y aparte soportar el olor? Es que de verdad esa gente es una sinvergüenza, no tienen respeto por nadie ni nada, y vaya y dígale algo a esa gente pa que vea como le responde a uno con 3 patadas. No son conscientes de absolutamente nadie, ni del bebé recién nacido a la abuela que está en sus últimos años de vida, esa gente le gusta pasarle a TODOS por encima.

Me arrecha que uno se tenga que calar las huevonadas de esa gente, y uno de toche no les dice nada, y aquí anda uno con gripe por culpa de esa gente sinvergüenza. Como se le ocurre que en esta semana nos hemos tenido que calar 4 VECES, 4 VECES la wachafita de estas personas??? 

Y luego aja quemaron toda esa vaina y dejaron ese desastre ahí todo regado; cenizas, basura que no se quemó del todo, árboles dañados, dejan un ambiente tan feo que a uno ni le dan ganas de pasar por esos lugares que antes eran bonitos.

Si usted es de esas personas que tiene como "hobbie" quemar basura por ahí para que los demás se coman todo ese humo, déjeme decirle desde lo más profundo de mi corazón que espero que algún dia se llegue a quemar el c*l0 por estar con esas huevonadas, haber si asi deja la wachafita esa.

Bajo petición informo: el 10 de octubre sufrió de un derrame cerebral después de su tercera semana en México. Luego de haber permanecido mes y medio en el hospital, falleció. Con esto me refiero a la persona que impulsó a la creación de nuestra wikia, que contestó y asistió a gran cantidad de usuarios a evitar los males relacionados a los gestores y cómo continuar procesos de la mejor manera posible, y formó amistades con varios de nosotros además de compartir muy buenos momentos y crear lindos recuerdos. El sub, con todo lo que tiene, es lo que es en parte gracias a sus esfuerzos.

Consulté a su familia antes de realizar este comunicado y les brindo nada menos que mi más sentido pésame, prefieren no compartir información personal pero quieren que sepan lo que ha sucedido para dar cierre a ello, además de evitar todavía recibir mensajes a sus cuentas privadas, y agradecen los buenos deseos en estos momentos difíciles.

Les deseo lo mejor tanto a ustedes como a la familia y a Trámites, que en paz descanse.

Voy a poner este hilo como anuncio hasta mañana en la tarde y agradezco que se mantenga, como mínimo, cordial. Se me cuidan.

7 Lives (7 Vidas) Trata de la historia de dos personas que tienen que cargar el peso del tiempo sobre sus hombros.

&#x200B;

Es una novela que escribí por ocio puro hace un tiempo, y que aproveché para llevar a una novela visual con las herramientas que tenía a la mano en el momento. La estaba promocionando con mi otra cuenta, pero se me olvidaron las credenciales jaja ( /u/otro_user_gil ).

&#x200B;

Aunque sea un proyecto simple, es algo que emociona porque puede ser el inicio de pasos más grandes en lo que espero hacer con estas historias sacadas de la nada.
